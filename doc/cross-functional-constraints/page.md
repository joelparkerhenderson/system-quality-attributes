# Cross-functional constraints (CFCs)

Cross-functional constraints (CFCs) refer to limitations or restrictions imposed on systems, such as computer software programs, that arise due to the interaction between different areas the system. These areas may include technical areas such as design, development, testing, and operations, as well as non-technical areas such as marketing, finance, and project management.

Examples:

* A data exchange constraint where two functions need to share data and thus must use the same data schema.

* An integration testing constraint where two modules must both be available in order for a holistic test to proceed.

* A budgetary constraint that limits the amount of resources available to the development team, which in turn affects the quality of the final product.

Cross-functional constraints are related to system quality attributes and non-functional requirements. These three terms focus on different aspects of a system's design and implementation:

* Cross-functional constraints highlight the need for coordination and collaboration between different functions within an organization to ensure that decisions are made in a holistic and integrated manner. 

* System quality attributes and non-functional requirements, on the other hand, help to ensure that the system performs efficiently and effectively based on the organization's needs and requirements.

In general, cross-functional constraints can arise from a variety of factors, including communication gaps, conflicting priorities, competing goals, and organizational silos. To manage these constraints effectively, teams must have a clear understanding of the interdependencies among areas, and must collaborate to identify and address potential issues. Effective communication, stakeholder management, and strategic planning are critical to managing cross-functional constraints and delivering successful projects.
