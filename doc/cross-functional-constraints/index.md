# Cross-functional constraints (CFCs)

Cross-functional constraints (CFCs) refer to limitations or restrictions imposed on software development projects that arise due to the interaction between different functional areas of a business or organization. These functional areas may include technical departments such as design, development, testing, and operations, as well as non-technical areas such as marketing, finance, and project management.

For example, a cross-functional constraint could be a delay in the project caused by a bottleneck in the testing phase because the design team did not provide the necessary documentation to the testing team to carry out their testing activities. Another constraint could be a budgetary constraint that limits the amount of resources available to the development team, which in turn affects the quality of the final product.

While cross-functional constraints, system quality attributes, and non-functional requirements are all related, they focus on different aspects of a system's design and implementation:

* Cross-functional constraints highlight the need for coordination and collaboration between different functions within an organization to ensure that decisions are made in a holistic and integrated manner. 

* System quality attributes and non-functional requirements, on the other hand, help to ensure that the system performs efficiently and effectively based on the organization's needs and requirements.

In general, cross-functional constraints can arise from a variety of factors, including communication gaps, conflicting priorities, competing goals, and organizational silos. To manage these constraints effectively, software development teams must have a clear understanding of the interdependencies between different functional areas and must work collaboratively to identify and address potential issues. Effective communication, stakeholder management, and strategic planning are critical to managing cross-functional constraints and delivering successful software projects.
