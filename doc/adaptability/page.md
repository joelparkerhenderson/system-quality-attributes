# Adaptability

**The quality/ability/extent of being adaptable. Compare adaptivity.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain adaptability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Adaptability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to have its users adjust or modify its behavior or structure in response to changing environmental conditions. This can include changes to the system's input or output, its user interfaces, its resources or processing capabilities, or its communication protocols.

Adaptability is a non-functional requirement for some kinds of systems with users who need to function under different operating conditions, where specific environmental factors (such as load fluctuation, network connectivity, and data volume) might impact system performance. Adaptability can affect various parts of the system's design, including user interfaces, and data management. Adaptability for data should be capable of having users change data structures, data business logic, and so forth.

Adaptability can be a cross-functional constraint because user-driven changes in one area of a system can have ripple effects in other areas. This can be especially important for compliance, governance, documentation, and training.<!--cfc-tech-->

**Define adaptable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define adaptable (computers and software)">Adaptable means capable of adjusting or modifying to fit different situations or conditions as needed, especially in response to changing circumstances without significant difficulty. In the context of computers and software, adaptable refers to the ability of software or hardware to easily and efficiently adjust to new or changing requirements, configuration, or interfaces without requiring extensive reconfiguration or coding changes. Adaptable systems can easily integrate new features, upgrades, or changes to the environment without compromising performance, user experience, or stability.</span>
