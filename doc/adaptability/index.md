# Adaptability

**Adaptability: the quality/ability/extent of being adaptable. Compare adaptivity.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain adaptability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement\)">

Adaptability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to have its users adjust or modify its behavior or structure in response to changing environmental conditions. This can include changes to the system's input or output, its user interfaces, its resources or processing capabilities, or its communication protocols.

As a non-functional requirement, adaptability is a qualitative attribute that describes a system's user's ability to change the system effectively. It is often an essential consideration for systems with users who need to function under different operating conditions, where specific environmental factors (such as load fluctuation, network connectivity, and data volume) might impact system performance.

Adaptability is also a cross-functional constraint that can affect various parts of the system's architecture and design, including software, hardware, user interfaces, and data management. For example, adaptable software enables users to modify the system to accommodate users' changing needs. In the same way, adaptable data management should be capable of having users change data structures, data sizes, inter-system data transfers, and so forth.

In the context of computers and software, adaptable refers to the ability of software or hardware to easily and efficiently adjust to new or changing requirements, configuration, or interfaces without requiring extensive reconfiguration or coding changes. Adaptable systems can easily integrate new features, upgrades, or changes to the environment without compromising performance, user experience, or stability.</span>
