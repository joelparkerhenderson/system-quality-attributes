# Usability

Usability: the quality/ability/extent of being usable.

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain usability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Usability is a system quality attribute, which means that it is a characteristic or property of a system that determines its ability to meet user needs and expectations. Usability refers to how easy and intuitive it is for users to interact with a system and accomplish their tasks, without experiencing frustration or confusion.

Usability is also considered a non-functional requirement, which are requirements that specify how the system should behave, rather than what functions it should perform. Non-functional requirements are important because they influence the overall performance, reliability, and maintainability of the system.

Moreover, usability is a cross-functional constraint, which means that it affects multiple aspects of the system, including the user interface design, system architecture, development methodology, and testing procedures. Usability is a constraint because it sets limits on how the system can be designed and developed to ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of its users.</span>
