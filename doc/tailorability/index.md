# Tailorability

Tailorability: the quality/ability/extent of being tailorable.

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain tailorability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Tailorability is a system quality attribute that represents the degree to which a system can be configured or customized to meet the specific needs of its users or stakeholders. It is a non-functional requirement that allows users to mold the system to fit their unique requirements or preferences.

Tailorability is a cross-functional constraint because it affects various aspects of the system, such as its usability, adaptability, and maintainability. For example, a highly tailorability system may require additional user training and documentation to guide users on how to tailor the system effectively. 

Tailorability is essential for systems that serve different users or user groups with varying needs and preferences. It enables users to personalize their experience, improve their efficiency and productivity, and reduce the risk of errors or dissatisfaction. Systems with low tailorability may create frustration or inefficiency due to the inability to meet specific user requirements.</span>
