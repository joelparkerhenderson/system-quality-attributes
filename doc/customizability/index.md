**Customizability: the quality/ability/extent of being customizable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain customizability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Customizability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to be easily modified or adapted to different user needs and preferences.

Customizability is a non-functional requirement because it doesn't describe what the system should do, but rather how it should behave. It is also a cross-functional constraint because it affects various aspects of a system, such as user interface design, software architecture, and data management.

Customizability is important in software systems because it allows users to tailor the application to their specific requirements, making it more efficient and effective. For example, a customizable email client may allow users to organize their inbox in different ways, change the color scheme, or add new features like spell-checking or message threading.

To achieve customizability, software systems must be designed with flexibility and modularity in mind. This may require the use of modular architectures, flexible data structures, and open APIs that allow for easy customization of the system. Similarly, user interfaces must be designed with customization in mind, providing users with intuitive tools to modify and personalize the system to their liking.
