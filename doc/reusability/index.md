# Reusability

**Reusability: the quality/ability/extent of being reusable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain reusability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement\)">

Reusability is a system quality attribute as it refers to the extent to which a system or its components can be utilized in other systems or applications without requiring significant modification or reconfiguration. It is also a non-functional requirement as it focuses on performance, maintainability, and scalability aspects. Furthermore, it can be considered a cross-functional constraint as it affects multiple aspects of a system, including its design, implementation, testing, and deployment. In short, reusability is an important attribute that helps reduce development costs, speeds up time-to-market, and enhances the overall quality of software systems.

These reusable components are generally designed to be generic and adaptable to different scenarios, making them a cost-effective and efficient way to build software solutions. In general, reusable code is characterized by its modularity, maintainability, flexibility, and portability.</span>
