# Consistency

**The quality/ability/extent of being consistent.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="consistency + template">

**Consistency** in systems refers to the uniformity and coherence of data, behavior, and interactions within and across components. It ensures that the system behaves predictably and provides reliable results, maintaining the integrity of data and processes.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, consistency ensures that the system operates in a uniform and predictable manner, providing reliable and accurate results.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that data remains accurate, complete, and uncorrupted across the system.
- **Behavioral Uniformity**: Consistent behavior of the system under similar conditions, providing predictable outcomes.
- **Synchronization**: Keeping multiple components or data sources in sync to prevent discrepancies.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), consistency specifies the criteria and standards for maintaining uniformity and coherence across the system. It defines how the system should handle data and interactions to ensure reliable performance.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Transactional Consistency**: Ensuring that transactions are processed in a reliable and predictable manner, maintaining data integrity.
- **Interface Consistency**: Providing uniform interfaces for interacting with the system, ensuring predictable behavior.
- **Error Handling**: Consistent and predictable handling of errors and exceptions across the system.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, consistency affects various aspects of system design, development, and operation. It requires collaboration across different teams to ensure that the system maintains uniformity and coherence.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Standardized Protocols**: Using standardized protocols and practices to ensure uniformity across the system.
- **Collaborative Design**: Involving multiple teams in designing and implementing consistent interactions and data handling practices.
- **Continuous Validation**: Regular validation and testing to ensure consistency is maintained throughout the system lifecycle.

### Implementing Consistency

To implement consistency, the following steps should be taken:
- **Establish Data Standards**: Define and enforce data standards to ensure data integrity and uniformity across the system.
- **Use Transactions**: Implement transactions where appropriate to ensure that operations are completed fully and reliably, maintaining data integrity.
- **Standardize Interfaces**: Design and enforce consistent interfaces for interacting with system components to ensure uniform behavior.
- **Implement Synchronization Mechanisms**: Use synchronization mechanisms to keep data and state consistent across different components and systems.
- **Conduct Regular Audits**: Perform regular audits and reviews to ensure that consistency standards are being adhered to and to identify and rectify any inconsistencies.

**Define consistent:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define consistent (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, consistent refers to the state of being uniform or constant in behavior, appearance, or performance. A consistent software application behaves in the same way each time it is used, providing predictable and reliable results. Similarly, consistent user interfaces across different applications or devices make it easy for users to navigate and understand the system. Consistency in coding practices makes it easier for developers to maintain and modify code over time.

* [Wikipedia: Consistency (database systems)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)): In database systems, consistency (or correctness) refers to the requirement that any given database transaction must change affected data only in allowed ways. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any defined database constraints. Consistency can also be understood as after a successful write, update or delete of a Record, any read request immediately receives the latest value of the Record.

* [Dictionary: consistent](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/consistent): agreeing or accordant; compatible; not self-contradictory. adhering to the same principles, course, form, etc. holding firmly together; cohering.
