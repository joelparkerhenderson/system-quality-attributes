# Consistency

**Consistency: the quality/ability/extent of being consistent.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain consistency (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement\)">

Consistency is a system quality attribute that denotes a requirement for a system to provide reliable and uniform behavior across different contexts and time periods.  It refers to the degree of similarity between system components, interfaces, interactions, and functionalities, which can make the system more usable, predictable, and maintainable. 

As a non-functional requirement, consistency is an essential aspect of the user experience, as it ensures that the system meets the users' expectations and needs without causing confusion or errors. A consistent system is more intuitive and familiar to users, reducing the learning curve and the chances of making mistakes. It also enhances transparency and accountability, enabling users to track and understand the system's behavior and outcomes.

Consistency is also a cross-functional constraint that affects various aspects of the system development and operation, such as design, coding, testing, documentation, and maintenance. It requires cooperation and collaboration among different stakeholders, such as designers, developers, testers, users, and managers, to ensure that the system's consistency is maintained throughout its life cycle. Examples of techniques and tools that support consistency include coding standards, style guides, user feedback, version control, test automation, and change management processes.

* [Wikipedia: Consistency (database systems)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)): In database systems, consistency (or correctness) refers to the requirement that any given database transaction must change affected data only in allowed ways. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any defined database constraints. Consistency can also be understood as after a successful write, update or delete of a Record, any read request immediately receives the latest value of the Record. 

* [Dictionary: consistent](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/consistent): agreeing or accordant; compatible; not self-contradictory. adhering to the same principles, course, form, etc. holding firmly together; cohering.

* [OpenAI: consistent](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define consistent (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, consistent refers to the state of being uniform or constant in behavior, appearance, or performance. A consistent software application behaves in the same way each time it is used, providing predictable and reliable results. Similarly, consistent user interfaces across different applications or devices make it easy for users to navigate and understand the system. Consistency in coding practices makes it easier for developers to maintain and modify code over time. Overall, consistency in technology is essential for ensuring efficient and effective outcomes.</span>
