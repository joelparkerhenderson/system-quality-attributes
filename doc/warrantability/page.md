# Warrantability

**The quality/ability/extent of being warrantable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain warrantability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Warrantability is a system quality attribute that describes the ability of a software system to be maintained and supported by the software vendor or by the customer's own technical team. It is a non-functional requirement that specifies that the software must be designed in such a way that it can be easily updated, maintained, and repaired as needed throughout its lifetime.

Warrantability is a cross-functional constraint that covers both technical and business aspects. From a technical point of view, warrantability requires that the system architecture and design be modular, extensible, and well-documented. It also requires that the system be built using industry standards and best practices to ensure that it can be easily understood and maintained by other developers.

From a business perspective, warrantability imposes a set of obligations on the software vendor to provide customer support, bug fixes, and updates to ensure the software remains functional and secure over time. It also imposes an obligation on the customer to keep their own technical team current and knowledgeable about the software and to provide the vendor with the necessary feedback to improve the software as necessary.

In sum, warrantability is a critically important quality attribute that ensures the continued usability and value of a software system over time. Software vendors and customers must work together to ensure that the software is well-designed, well-documented, and well-maintained to meet the needs of all stakeholders.
