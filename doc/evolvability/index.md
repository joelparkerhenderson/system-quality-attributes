# Evolvability

Evolvability: the quality/ability/extent of being evolvable.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain evolvability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Evolvability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a software system to adapt and evolve to meet changing business or technological needs. It is a non-functional requirement because it does not directly specify the system features or functionality, but rather its ability to adapt and change over time. It is also a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple aspects of the system, such as its architecture, design, and development practices.

Evolvability is achieved through the use of modular, scalable, and maintainable software architecture and design principles. This allows the system to be easily modified, extended, or enhanced as new functionality or requirements are introduced. In addition, evolvability requires robust testing and validation procedures to ensure that changes to the system do not introduce new errors or vulnerabilities.

An evolvable system is able to remain relevant and useful over time, even as the business environment or technology landscape evolves. This makes it a valuable asset for organizations that need to stay competitive and responsive to changing market conditions.
