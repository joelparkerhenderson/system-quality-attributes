# Process capability

**The quality/ability/extent of being process capable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain Process capability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Process capability refers to the ability of a system or process to consistently produce products or services that meet predetermined specifications and quality standards. It is a system quality attribute, meaning that it reflects the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the system as a whole.

Process capability is also considered a non-functional requirement, as it is not directly related to the functional requirements of the system (i.e. the specific features and capabilities that it must perform), but is instead focused on the quality and performance of those features.

Additionally, process capability can be considered a cross-functional constraint, as it generally involves the coordination and integration of multiple functions within an organization, from design and manufacturing to quality control and customer service. It requires a collaborative approach to ensure that all aspects of the system are working together to achieve consistent quality and performance.

**Define process:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define process capable (computers and software)">Process capable refers to the ability of a computer or software to handle and execute a specific task or set of tasks efficiently and accurately. A process capable system can perform its function without errors or delays, even under high workload or demanding conditions. The capability of a system is determined by factors such as its processing power, memory, and software design. A process capable system is essential for carrying out complex operations such as data analytics, modeling and simulation, and advanced graphics processing.</span>
