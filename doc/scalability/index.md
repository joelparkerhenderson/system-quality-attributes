# Scalability

**Scalability: the quality/ability/extent of being scalable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain scalability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Scalability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to handle growing amounts of workload or handle more users, resources, or data without sacrificing performance or crashing. Scalability is a non-functional requirement in software engineering that determines how well a system responds to increasing amounts of data, traffic, or requests.

Scalability is also a cross-functional constraint that impacts various stakeholders including developers, operations, and business teams. From the development standpoint, scalable systems require robust and flexible architectures, optimized coding practices, and efficient utilization of hardware resources. From the operations side, scalable systems demand reliable infrastructures, high availability, and efficient monitoring and maintenance processes. From the business perspective, scalable systems drive revenue, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage by enabling easy and seamless scaling without disrupting the user experience.

In summary, scalability is a crucial attribute that determines the long-term viability and success of a system, application, or service. It enables businesses to grow and adapt to changing market conditions and user demands while ensuring consistent performance and reliability.</span>

Scalability can be measured over multiple dimensions, such as:

* Administrative scalability: The ability for an increasing number of organizations or users to access a system.

* Functional scalability: The ability to enhance the system by adding new functionality without disrupting existing  activities.

* Geographic scalability: The ability to maintain effectiveness during expansion from a local area to a larger region.

* Load scalability: The ability for a distributed system to expand and contract to accommodate heavier or lighter loads, including, the ease with which a system or component can be modified, added, or removed, to accommodate changing loads.

* Generation scalability: The ability of a system to scale by adopting new generations of components.

* Heterogeneous scalability is the ability to adopt components from different vendors.


**Define scalable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define scalable (computers and software)">Scalable refers to the ability of computer hardware, software or applications to adapt to increased demand or usage, without sacrificing performance or functionality. It means that a system can handle an increase in workload or users in a cost-effective manner without compromising quality or speed. The scalability of a system is usually achieved through the use of efficient hardware and software architectures, as well as the ability to add more resources or capacity as needed.</span>
