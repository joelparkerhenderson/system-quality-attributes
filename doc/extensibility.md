<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain extensibility (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Extensibility is a system quality attribute that represents the system's capacity to extend its functionality or accommodate new features and requirements efficiently. It is a non-functional requirement that describes the ease with which the system can incorporate new functionality without disrupting the existing system's structure or requiring significant changes.

Extensibility is a cross-functional constraint as it impacts various stakeholders involved in the system's development, such as developers, testers, end-users, business analysts, and system administrators. It influences the system's overall architecture, design, and implementation, and affects the system's maintainability, scalability, and adaptability.

In summary, extensibility is an essential system quality attribute that enables a system to incorporate new features and requirements without disrupting existing functionality. It is a non-functional requirement that has cross-functional implications and plays a critical role in the success of a system
