# Blastability

**The quality/ability/extent of being blasted.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain blastability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Blastability in the context of software engineering and system design refers to the system's ability to withstand sudden, high-impact events or changes without significant degradation in performance or availability. This concept can be crucial for systems that need to remain operational under extreme conditions, such as cyber-attacks, unexpected load spikes, or catastrophic failures.

Blastability is a system quality attribute that describes a characteristic of the system that contributes to its overall resilience and robustness. Quality attributes like reliability, scalability, and security collectively define the system's performance and user experience under various conditions. Blastability specifically addresses the system's capability to endure and recover from high-impact disruptions.

Blastability is a non-functional requirement (NFR) because it specifies criteria that judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors or functions. It defines how the system performs under specific conditions rather than what it does.

Blastability is a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple areas of system design and development, requiring collaboration across different teams and disciplines. This attribute imposes constraints that must be considered by architects, developers, testers, and operations teams.

* [Wikipedia: Blast radius](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_radius): The term blast radius, in the context of software security and cloud computing, is used to designate the impact that a security breach of one single component of an application, or destruction of one single capability of a system, could have on the overall composite application or system. Reducing the blast radius of any component is a security good practice. The concept is used in Zero trust security model and chaos engineering.
