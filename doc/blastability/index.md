Availability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system or application to be accessible and operational for use. It indicates the percentage of time that a system or application remains available and responsive to user requests.

Availability is a non-functional requirement, which means that it is a specification of how the system should behave rather than what it should do. It is an important factor for systems that require high up-times, such as critical systems in healthcare, finance, or transportation. To maintain high availability, systems need to be designed with redundancy, fault-tolerance, and disaster recovery mechanisms. They also need to be monitored and maintained regularly to ensure that any issues are identified and resolved quickly. High availability (HA) is an important topic in system architecture and testing.

Availability is a cross-functional constraint, primarily because it affects the user experience and overall satisfaction. For example, when a system has availability problems, then users may complain, or take up extra support resources, or cancel subscriptions.

Reducing the blast radius of any component is a security good practice. The concept is used in Zero trust security model and chaos engineering.
