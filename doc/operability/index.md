<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain operability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement\)">

Operability is a system quality attribute, which refers to the ease with which a system can be operated, controlled, and monitored. It is a non-functional requirement, which focuses on how well the system works rather than what it does. 

Operability relates to the cross-functional constraints that affect the system design and implementation. It is affected by various factors such as human factors, system reliability, system availability, system maintainability, and system safety.

Operability is critical for software systems that require frequent monitoring, configuration, and maintenance. An operable system can minimize the time it takes to perform operations, troubleshoot problems, and recover from failures. It can enhance the usability of the system, reduce errors, and improve user satisfaction.

In summary, operability is an essential quality attribute that ensures that the system is easy to operate, monitor, maintain, and support. It is a non-functional requirement that should be considered in the overall system design and implementation.
