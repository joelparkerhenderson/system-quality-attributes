# Availability

**The quality/ability/extent of being available.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="availability + template">

**Availability** in systems refers to the degree to which a system is operational and accessible when needed for use. It is a measure of the system's readiness and its ability to provide continuous services without interruption.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, availability signifies the importance of a system being consistently operational and accessible to users and other systems.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Uptime:** The percentage of time the system is operational and available for use.
- **Redundancy:** The implementation of backup components and systems to ensure continuous operation in case of failures.
- **Fault Tolerance:** The system's ability to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), availability defines the conditions and standards that the system must meet to ensure it remains operational and accessible.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Agreements that specify the expected level of availability and the consequences of not meeting these expectations.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Mechanisms to continuously monitor system health and alert administrators to potential issues that could impact availability.
- **Maintenance and Updates:** Processes to ensure regular maintenance and timely updates without significant downtime.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, availability imposes requirements that impact various aspects of the system, including design, implementation, and operations, to ensure the system is consistently available.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Security:** Ensuring that security measures do not hinder availability, balancing protection with accessibility.
- **Scalability:** The ability to maintain high availability even as the system scales to accommodate more users or higher loads.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Plans and processes to quickly restore availability in case of catastrophic failures or disasters.

### Implementing Availability

To implement availability in a system, consider the following steps:
- **Design for Redundancy:** Implement redundant systems and components to ensure continuous operation in case of failures.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Establish comprehensive monitoring systems to track the health and performance of the system in real-time.
- **Automate Failover Processes:** Develop automated failover mechanisms to switch to backup systems seamlessly when primary systems fail.
- **Regular Maintenance:** Schedule regular maintenance to keep the system updated and in good health without causing significant downtime.
- **Implement Robust Security:** Ensure security measures protect the system without compromising availability, including DDoS protection and intrusion detection systems.
- **Develop a Disaster Recovery Plan:** Create and regularly update a disaster recovery plan to quickly restore operations in case of major disruptions.

By focusing on these aspects and steps, systems can achieve high availability, ensuring they remain operational and accessible to users at all times.

**Define available:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define available (computers and software)">Available refers to computers and software that are currently accessible and ready for use. These resources can be either physical or virtual and are typically ready to be utilized at any time without requiring extensive setup or configuration. Availability may be affected by factors such as network connectivity, hardware reliability, and software compatibility. In general, available computers and software are considered to be reliable resources that can be used to perform a variety of tasks, ranging from basic productivity work to complex analytical tasks.</span>
