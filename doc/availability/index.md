# Availability

Availability: the quality/ability/extent of being available.

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain availability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Availability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system or application to be accessible and operational for use by authorized users. It indicates the percentage of time that a system or application remains available and responsive to user requests.

Availability is a non-functional requirement, which means that it is a specification of how the system should behave rather than what it should do. It is an important factor for systems that require high up-times, such as critical systems in healthcare, finance, or transportation.

Availability is also a cross-functional constraint, meaning that it affects multiple aspects of the system. It can impact the performance, scalability, and reliability of the system, as well as the user experience and overall satisfaction.

To maintain high availability, systems need to be designed with redundancy, fault-tolerance, and disaster recovery mechanisms. They also need to be monitored and maintained regularly to ensure that any issues are identified and resolved quickly.</span>
