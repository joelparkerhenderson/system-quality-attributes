# Degradability

Degradability: the quality/ability/extent of being degradable.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain degradability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Degradability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to operate at an acceptable level of performance even when certain components or resources are unavailable. 

Degradability is a non-functional requirement that is essential for systems that are critical to business operations or public safety.

Degradability is a cross-functional constraint that affects multiple aspects of a system's design, implementation, and maintenance. It requires careful consideration of factors such as fault tolerance, redundancy, load balancing, and failover mechanisms.

A system that is not sufficiently degradable may experience catastrophic failure in the event of an unexpected outage or overload. This can lead to significant financial losses, loss of life, or damage to the reputation of the organization that operates the system.

In contrast, a highly degradable system can continue to operate even during adverse conditions, allowing critical functions to continue without interruption. This can help to increase the reliability, availability, and maintainability of the system, which are all important considerations for ensuring business continuity and public safety.

* [Dictionary: degrade](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/degrade): to reduce in amount, strength, intensity, etc. to lower in character or quality.

* [OpenAI: degradable](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define degradable (computers and software)">Degradable refers to computer hardware or software that progressively loses functionality or performance over time. It may occur due to aging, obsolescence, wear and tear, or becoming outdated as newer and faster technology becomes available. Degradable components may cause computer systems to operate slower, glitch, or eventually fail altogether. Upgrading or replacing degradable parts is necessary to maintain system performance and prevent further degradation.</div>
