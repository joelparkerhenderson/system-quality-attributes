# Controllability

**The quality/ability/extent of being controllable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain controllability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Controllability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system or its components to be easily managed, monitored, and controlled, typically by its users, administrators, and other stakeholders. 


Controllability is a non-functional requirement, and it impacts various aspects of a system, including usability, reliability, and security. Controllability may also be a cross-cutting concern, for example if controls span multiple areas of the system.

Controllability is also a cross-functional constraint: TODO

In practical terms, controllability means that a system should provide interfaces, tools, and mechanisms that enable users to manage and control its behavior, performance, and other aspects. For example, an operating system should provide a user-friendly interface to allow users to manage system resources, such as memory, disk space, and CPU usage. Likewise, a database management system should provide tools to monitor and maintain data integrity, performance, and security.

A system that is difficult to control and manage can lead to operational issues, such as downtime, data loss, and security breaches. Therefore, system designers and business stakeholders should work toward systems that are easy to control and manage.

**Define controllable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define controllable (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, controllable refers to the ability of a user or program to manipulate and manage the behavior and operations of the system. This can include changing settings, configuring options, selecting inputs and outputs, and executing commands to achieve desired outcomes. It may also refer to the degree to which a system can be easily monitored and modified by an administrator or other authorized user. Overall, controllability is a key aspect of ensuring that a computer or software system is effective, efficient, and optimally performing its intended functions.</span>
