# Controllability

Controllability: the quality/ability/extent of being controllable.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain controllability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Controllability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system or its components to be easily managed, monitored, and controlled. It is a non-functional requirement that defines the degree to which a system can be controlled by its users, administrators, and other stakeholders. Controllability is also a cross-functional constraint, as it impacts various aspects of a system, including usability, reliability, and security.

In practical terms, controllability means that a system should provide interfaces, tools, and mechanisms that enable users to manage and control its behavior, performance, and other aspects. For example, an operating system should provide a user-friendly interface to allow users to manage system resources, such as memory, disk space, and CPU usage. Likewise, a database management system should provide tools to monitor and maintain data integrity, performance, and security.

Controllability is critical for ensuring the reliability, availability, and security of a system. A system that is difficult to control and manage can lead to operational issues, such as downtime, data loss, and security breaches. Therefore, system designers and architects should consider controllability as an essential quality attribute, and should design systems that are easy to control and manage.</div>

* [Wikipedia: Control system](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system): A control system manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems using control loops. It can range from a single home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines. The control systems are designed via control engineering process. 

* [Dictionary: control](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/control): to exercise direction over; dominate: command.
To hold in check; curb. the situation of being under the regulation, domination, or command of another..

* [OpenAI: controllable](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define controllable (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, controllable refers to the ability of a user or program to manipulate and manage the behavior and operations of the system. This can include changing settings, configuring options, selecting inputs and outputs, and executing commands to achieve desired outcomes. It may also refer to the degree to which a system can be easily monitored and modified by an administrator or other authorized user. Overall, controllability is a key aspect of ensuring that a computer or software system is effective, efficient, and optimally performing its intended functions.</div>
