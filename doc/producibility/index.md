# Producibility

Producibility: the quality/ability/extent of being producable.

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain Producibility (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Producibility is a system quality attribute which refers to the ease and efficiency with which a software system can be developed, tested, deployed and maintained. It is primarily concerned with ensuring that the software system can be feasibly and effectively produced.

As a non-functional requirement, producibility is often included as part of the requirements specification for software development. It ensures that the software system can be developed and maintained within available resources, time, and budget. Additionally, it is important to understand how producibility affects the quality of the system as a whole.

Producibility is also a cross-functional constraint because it affects all aspects of the software development lifecycle from the better design concept phase to the final delivery phase. Professionals from different departments, such as developers, testers, deployment engineers, and maintenance personnel must all be able to work together to ensure that the software system is not only robust and efficient but also commercially viable.

Therefore, producibility is a critical aspect of any software development project which ensures that software resources are optimized and are cost-effective.</span>

* [Dictionary: produce](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/produce) Produce. to bring into existence; give rise to; cause. to bring into existence by intellectual or creative ability.

* [OpenAI: producable](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define producable (computers and software)">Producible refers to the ability of a computer or software program to be manufactured or developed within relevant technological constraints, in a cost-effective manner, and within a defined timeframe. It involves ensuring that the technology and resources required to create the product are available, and that the design and manufacturing processes are optimized to achieve efficient production. In the context of software development, producibility also includes considerations such as coding standards, testing procedures, and documentation practices to ensure that the final product is functional, reliable, and maintainable.</span>
