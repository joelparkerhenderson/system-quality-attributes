Compatibility is a system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, and cross-functional constraint that ensures the system can function correctly and cohesively with other hardware, software, networks, and operating systems. Compatibility is essential for systems to communicate and exchange data with each other seamlessly.

Compatibility can be tested and measured by ensuring that the system performs as expected in different environments, configurations, and platforms. Compatibility testing involves testing the system's ability to coexist with other systems and to function flawlessly in various scenarios.

Compatibility also helps to ensure that the system can evolve and adapt to new technologies, trends, and standards. It is a crucial factor that impacts the system's reliability, performance, and usability.
