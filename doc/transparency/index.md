# Transparency

Transparency: the quality/ability/extent of being transparent.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain transparency (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Transparency is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to provide visibility and clarity into its operations, internal workings, and decision-making processes. It is often used to promote trust and accountability in systems, particularly those that are used by multiple stakeholders or that involve significant amounts of data or decision-making.

As a non-functional requirement, transparency specifies that a system must be designed and implemented in such a way that it allows users to easily access, understand, and verify its output and decision-making processes. This can include providing detailed documentation, clear user interfaces, and audit trails that allow users to track how data is being processed and how decisions are being made. 

As a cross-functional constraint, transparency can impact a range of different aspects of a system's design and implementation, from the choice of algorithms and data structures used to process information, to the level of external oversight and governance that must be put in place to ensure that the system is being used ethically and effectively. 

Overall, transparency is an important quality attribute that can help to promote trust and accountability in systems, particularly those that are used in sensitive or critical contexts. Investing in transparency can help to ensure that systems are designed with the needs of users and stakeholders in mind, while also promoting ethical and responsible use of data and technology.</div>

It suggests that the system operates smoothly and efficiently without causing any disruptions or requiring any special attention from the user. A transparent system is typically intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for the user to interact with and access the information they need without any unnecessary complexity or confusion.</div>
