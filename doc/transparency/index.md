# Transparency

**The quality/ability/extent of being transparent.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain transparency (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Transparency is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to provide visibility and clarity into its operations, internal workings, and decision-making processes. It is often used to promote trust and accountability in systems, particularly those that are used by multiple stakeholders or that involve significant amounts of data or decision-making.

As a non-functional requirement, transparency specifies that a system must be designed and implemented in such a way that it allows users to easily access, understand, and verify its output and decision-making processes. This can include providing detailed documentation, clear user interfaces, and audit trails that allow users to track how data is being processed and how decisions are being made.

As a cross-functional constraint, transparency can impact a range of different aspects of a system's design and implementation, from the choice of algorithms and data structures used to process information, to the level of external oversight and governance that must be put in place to ensure that the system is being used ethically and effectively.

**Define transparent:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define transparent (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, transparent means functioning in such a way that the user is not aware of its operation or inner workings. It suggests that the system operates smoothly and efficiently without causing any disruptions or requiring any special attention from the user. A transparent system is typically intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for the user to interact with and access the information they need without any unnecessary complexity or confusion.</span>
