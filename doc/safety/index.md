# Safety

Safety: the quality/ability/extent of being safe.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain safety (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Safety is a system quality attribute, which is an important non-functional requirement and a cross-functional constraint that focuses on ensuring that a system is free from harm or danger to users, operators, the environment, and other stakeholders. 

A high level of safety is a critical aspect of a system's functionality, particularly in applications where human life, health, or the environment are at risk. It is essential to consider safety requirements while designing, developing, and testing a system. The goal is to prevent or mitigate any potential hazards, such as physical injury, property damage, or environmental harm. 

A system's safety requirements usually include regulatory compliance guidelines, industry standards, best practices, and risk assessments. To meet these requirements, developers must incorporate safety-conscious design practices and implement appropriate safety controls in their systems. These practices may include incorporating redundant systems, implementing fail-safe mechanisms, and providing adequate training and support for users and operators. 

Overall, safety is an essential system quality attribute that must be considered throughout the entire system development lifecycle. Failure to meet safety requirements could result in severe consequences, including legal liabilities, damage to the system's reputation, or loss of life or property. Therefore, it is vital to ensure that a system is safe and secure, in addition to its functional capabilities.</div>

* [OpenAI: safe](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define safe (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, "safe" generally means that the technology does not do any harm to the user's system, data or privacy. A safe software or application is one that functions properly and reliably, without crashing, corrupting data or opening security vulnerabilities. Safe software is also free from malware or viruses, and does not engage in any malicious activities such as phishing, spying, or stealing user data. Safe computers refer to systems that are secure from external and internal threats, such as cyber-attacks, viruses, and unauthorized access.</div>
