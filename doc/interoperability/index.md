# Interoperability

Interoperability: the quality/ability/extent of being interoperable.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain interoperability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Interoperability refers to the ability of different systems or components to work together effectively, without imposing any restrictions or limitations on each other. 

Interoperability is a system quality attribute because it relates to the overall ability of a system to function properly and deliver the desired outcomes. 

Interoperability is a non-functional requirement because it specifies how different system components should interact with each other in terms of performance, reliability, and security. 

Interoperability is a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple aspects of system design, development, and operation, including hardware and software compatibility, network connectivity, data exchange protocols, and user interface standards. Achieving high levels of interoperability requires careful planning, testing, and coordination, as well as the use of open standards and established best practices.</div>

* [Dictionary: interoperable](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/interoperable): capable of being used or operated reciprocally.

* [OpenAI: interoperable](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define interoperable (computers and software)">Interoperable refers to the ability of computers and software systems to communicate and work seamlessly with each other, regardless of the operating system or programming language used. Interoperability enables different systems to share data and access each other's resources, enabling efficient data transfer and collaboration between different applications or platforms. This is crucial for ensuring that different technologies can work together seamlessly and can be used interchangeably to achieve a common goal or objective.</div>
