<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain failure-transparency (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Failure-transparency is a system quality attribute that ensures that a system's failures are communicated to its users, administrators, and other stakeholders in a clear and timely manner. This attribute is essential for building trust in the system and fostering a culture of responsibility and accountability.

As a non-functional requirement, failure-transparency specifies how a system should handle errors, exceptions, and other types of failures. It requires that the system provide detailed and accurate error messages, logs, and other diagnostic information to help users and administrators understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

Failure-transparency is also a cross-functional constraint, meaning that it affects multiple aspects of a system and requires collaboration across different teams and departments. For example, developers must design the system to generate informative error messages, while operations teams must ensure that logs are accessible and easy to analyze.

In summary, failure-transparency is an essential system quality attribute that helps ensure that failures are communicated effectively and efficiently to all stakeholders. As a non-functional requirement and cross-functional constraint, it requires collaboration and coordination across different teams and functions to achieve.
