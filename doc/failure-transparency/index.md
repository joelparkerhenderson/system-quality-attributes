# Failure-transparency

**Failure-transparency: the quality/ability/extent of being failure-transparent.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain failure-transparency (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Failure-transparency is a system quality attribute that ensures that a system's failures are communicated to its users, administrators, and other stakeholders in a clear and timely manner. This attribute is essential for building trust in the system and fostering a culture of responsibility and accountability.

As a non-functional requirement, failure-transparency specifies how a system should handle errors, exceptions, and other types of failures. It requires that the system provide detailed and accurate error messages, logs, and other diagnostic information to help users and administrators understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

Failure-transparency is also a cross-functional constraint, meaning that it affects multiple aspects of a system and requires collaboration across different teams and departments. For example, developers must design the system to generate informative error messages, while operations teams must ensure that logs are accessible and easy to analyze.

In summary, failure-transparency is an essential system quality attribute that helps ensure that failures are communicated effectively and efficiently to all stakeholders. As a non-functional requirement and cross-functional constraint, it requires collaboration and coordination across different teams and functions to achieve.

* [OpenAI: failure-transparent](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define failure-transparent (computers and software)">Failure-transparent is a term used in computer science and software engineering to describe a system or software that is resilient and able to handle failures without disrupting or completely stopping the system's operation. A failure-transparent system can detect and handle errors, failures, and unexpected events without compromising the overall functioning of the system. Such a system is designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring the continuity of the system's operation even in the face of hardware, software, or network failures. In simple terms, a failure-transparent system is one that fails gracefully, allowing the system to continue functioning despite any issues or faults that may arise.</span>
