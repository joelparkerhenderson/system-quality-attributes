# Integrity

**The quality/ability/extent of having integrity. <!-- TODO -->**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="integrity + template">

**Integrity** in systems refers to the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data and processes within the system. It ensures that data remains correct and unaltered from unauthorized modifications or corruption, and that the system functions as intended without unintended alterations.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, integrity focuses on maintaining the correctness and reliability of data and processes. It ensures that data remains accurate and consistent throughout its lifecycle and that operations are executed correctly according to specifications.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring that data is precise and reflects the real-world values it represents.
- **Consistency**: Maintaining uniformity of data across different parts of the system and between various system states.
- **Protection from Unauthorized Changes**: Safeguarding data and processes from unauthorized or unintended modifications, ensuring that changes are made only through proper channels.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), integrity defines the expectations for how data and operations are protected from corruption, loss, or unauthorized alterations. It is critical for ensuring that the system delivers reliable and accurate results.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Data Validation**: Implementing mechanisms to verify the correctness and validity of data inputs and outputs.
- **Error Handling**: Establishing procedures for detecting and addressing errors or inconsistencies in data and operations.
- **Access Control**: Defining and enforcing rules to control who can access and modify data, ensuring that only authorized users can make changes.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, integrity impacts various aspects of system design and operation. It requires coordination across different teams and systems to ensure that data and processes remain accurate and reliable.

#### Key Aspects:
- **System Design**: Designing the system with built-in checks and balances to maintain data integrity throughout its lifecycle.
- **Security**: Implementing robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and modifications that could compromise data integrity.
- **Testing and Validation**: Performing rigorous testing to identify and address potential integrity issues, ensuring that the system behaves as expected in all scenarios.

### Implementing Integrity

To implement integrity:
- **Data Validation and Verification**: Incorporate mechanisms for validating and verifying data inputs and outputs. Use checksums, hash functions, or other techniques to ensure data integrity.
- **Access Control Measures**: Establish and enforce strict access control policies to prevent unauthorized access and modifications. Use authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can make changes.
- **Error Detection and Handling**: Develop robust error detection and handling procedures to identify and correct inconsistencies or errors. Implement logging and monitoring to track and respond to integrity issues.
- **Regular Audits and Reviews**: Conduct regular audits and reviews of data and processes to ensure ongoing compliance with integrity requirements. Periodically test the system to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**Define integrity:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define integrity (computers and software)">Integrity in computers and software refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data and system operations. It involves protecting data and systems from unauthorized modification, deletion, or corruption. Maintaining the integrity of computers and software ensures that they function as intended and produce dependable results. It is crucial in areas such as data security, financial transactions, and legal documentation, where inaccurate or unreliable information can have serious consequences.</span>
