# Integrity

Integrity: the quality/ability/extent of having integrity. <!-- TODO -->

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain integrity (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Integrity is a system quality attribute, a non-functional requirement, and a cross-functional constraint that refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data or information in a system. It ensures that the data in the system is complete, accurate, and secure throughout its lifecycle. This is achieved through measures such as data encryption, access controls, and data validation.

As a system quality attribute, integrity is an essential characteristic that determines the effectiveness and reliability of a system. It should be considered as a key requirement alongside other functional and non-functional aspects of the system. A well-designed and implemented system must have integrity to prevent errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies in the data.

As a non-functional requirement, integrity specifies a system's performance, security, and usability aspects that cannot be directly measured or observed. It is typically derived from business needs and regulations that require the system to maintain the accuracy, trustworthiness, and confidentiality of data. Examples of non-functional requirements that align with integrity include data validation processes, data encryption mechanisms, system log and audit trails, and access controls and permissions.

As a cross-functional constraint, integrity is a requirement that cuts across multiple functions and stakeholders in a system. It requires collaboration between developers, testers, security professionals, and other stakeholders to ensure that the system meets the required level of integrity. The implementation of integrity controls often requires close coordination and communication between different teams to minimize the risk of data breaches, system failures, or data loss.</span>
