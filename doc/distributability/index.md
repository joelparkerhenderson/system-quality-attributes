# Distributability

**Distributability: the quality/ability/extent of being distributable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain distributability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Distributability refers to the capability of a system or application to be distributed over multiple nodes or servers, enabling it to provide higher availability, scalability, and fault-tolerance.

Distributability is a system quality attribute that emphasizes the importance of sharing workloads among different nodes or servers, thus avoiding single points of failure and reducing the risk of system downtime.

As a non-functional requirement, distributability demands that the system architecture is designed in such a way that it can distribute and balance workloads efficiently without sacrificing performance or security.

Distributability can also be viewed as a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple areas of the system design and implementation, such as network topology, data storage, communication protocols, and security mechanisms. Therefore, the ability to distribute a system and its components is an important consideration for architects, developers, and operations teams alike.

These programs are typically designed to be installed on multiple devices and used by multiple users. Distributable software often includes licensing terms that specify the conditions under which it can be distributed, such as the number of users or devices allowed to use the program, and any restrictions on its use or distribution.</span>
