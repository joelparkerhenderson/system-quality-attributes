# Modularity

Modularity: the quality/ability/extent of being modular.

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain modularity (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Modularity is a system quality attribute that refers to the degree to which a system is composed of separate, independent components or modules that can be easily interconnected, modified, and replaced without affecting the rest of the system. Modularity allows for flexibility and ease of maintenance, as well as scalability and interoperability with other systems.

Modularity is also a non-functional requirement, as it is not directly related to the primary functionality of the system but rather how that functionality is achieved. It is usually specified as a requirement in system design and architecture documents, and can be measured through metrics such as coupling and cohesion.

Finally, modularity can also be considered a cross-functional constraint, as it impacts multiple aspects of the system, including development, testing, maintenance, and integration. It requires coordination and collaboration between different teams and stakeholders involved in building and using the system, and can affect the overall cost, schedule, and quality of the system.</span>

* [OpenAI: modular](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define modular (computers and software)">Modular refers to a design or structure that is composed of separate parts or modules that can be easily interconnected or separated. In the context of computers and software, a modular system refers to a system where the overall functionality is achieved by combining smaller, independent components called modules. These modules can be combined or replaced with other compatible modules to easily modify or upgrade the system without affecting other parts of the system. This approach to design allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and customization of the system.</span>
