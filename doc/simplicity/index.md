<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain simplicity (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement\)">

Simplicity is a system quality attribute that refers to the ease of understanding and using a software system. It is a non-functional requirement that specifies that the software should be easy to learn, use, and maintain. Simplicity involves minimizing complexity, avoiding unnecessary features, and designing a system with a clear and intuitive user interface.

Simplicity is also sometimes considered a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple areas of the software development process. It impacts design, development, testing, and maintenance, as well as the overall user experience of the system. As a cross-functional constraint, simplicity requires collaboration between all members of the development team to ensure the system meets the simplicity requirement.
