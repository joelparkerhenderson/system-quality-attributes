<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain agility (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Agility is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to adapt to changing requirements and environments quickly and efficiently. An agile system can easily change and evolve over time to meet new demands, make modifications or enhancements, and respond to unforeseen events.

Agility is a non-functional requirement because it does not describe the specific functionalities of a system, but rather how well it can adapt. To achieve agility, a system should be designed with modularity, flexibility, scalability, and robustness in mind. Additionally, an agile system requires a strong testing and validation process to ensure that changes can be made while maintaining system integrity and functional requirements. 

Agility can be a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple stakeholders of a system, including its developers, project managers, product leaders, and accountable executives. Notably, Agile is a software development methodology, and an approach to project management, that emphasizes cross-functional collaboration, flexibility, continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction.
