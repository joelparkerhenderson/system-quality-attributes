# Agility

Agility: the quality/ability/extent of being agile.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain agility (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Agility is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to adapt to changing requirements and environments quickly and efficiently. 

Agility is a non-functional requirement because it does not describe the specific functionalities of a system, but rather how well it can operate under certain circumstances. 

Finally, agility can also be considered a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple aspects of a system, including its design, architecture, and implementation. An agile system can easily change and evolve over time to meet new demands, make modifications or enhancements, and respond to unforeseen events.

To achieve agility, a system should be designed with modularity, flexibility, scalability, and robustness in mind. Additionally, an agile system requires a strong testing and validation process to ensure that changes can be made while maintaining system integrity and functional requirements.</div>
