# Standards compliance

**Standards compliance: the quality/ability/extent of being standards compliant.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain standards compliance (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Standards compliance refers to the extent to which a system adheres to established guidelines, regulations, or frameworks that dictate how software should be designed, developed, and deployed. This is important because it ensures that the system meets certain levels of quality, interoperability, security, and reliability, among other characteristics that are critical to successful system performance.

As a system quality attribute, standards compliance is concerned with how well a system meets specific requirements that are imposed by regulatory bodies, industry consortia, or other authoritative organizations. For example, a system that complies with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard for information security management demonstrates its ability to safeguard sensitive data and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information across the enterprise.

As a non-functional requirement, standards compliance represents a set of criteria that the system must meet in order to be considered acceptable for deployment. Non-functional requirements are not features or functionalities per se, but rather operational characteristics, such as performance, scalability, maintainability, and usability, that must be satisfied in order to ensure successful system operation.

As a cross-functional constraint, standards compliance reflects the need for multiple system components, modules, or subsystems to work together seamlessly and in conformity with a set of predefined rules or procedures. This may require the use of specific data formats, communication protocols, or other mechanisms that facilitate interoperability and communication between different system elements. For example, a system that complies with the HL7 standard for healthcare data exchange can seamlessly share patient information across different provider organizations, enabling better coordinated and more efficient care.

**Define standards:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define standards compliance (computers and software)">Standards compliance in the context of computers and software refers to the extent to which a product or system adheres to recognized norms or best practices. Compliance with standards can ensure that software and hardware components are interoperable, reliable, and secure. Standards compliance may include adherence to technical specifications, industry-specific regulations or requirements, and compatibility with other systems, platforms, or devices. In addition, compliance with standards may be required to protect against legal liabilities, ensure data privacy, and achieve industry certifications or accreditations.</span>
