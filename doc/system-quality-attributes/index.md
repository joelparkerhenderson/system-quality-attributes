# System quality attributes (SQAs)

System quality attributes (SQAs) refer to a set of characteristics that define the overall quality of computer software systems. These attributes determine how well the system performs in terms of functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, security, and maintainability.

* Functionality: The ability of the software to perform its intended tasks without errors or bugs. It includes features such as accuracy, completeness, and compliance with user requirements.

* Reliability: The software's ability to operate consistently and predictably under various conditions. It includes attributes like fault tolerance, availability, and recoverability.

* Usability: The ease of use and learnability of the software. It includes attributes like user interface design, user experience, and accessibility.

* Efficiency: The software's ability to perform its tasks in a timely and resource-efficient manner. It includes attributes like speed, processing time, and memory usage.

* Security: The software's ability to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. It includes attributes like confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

* Maintainability: The software's ability to be modified or updated easily to meet changing requirements. It includes attributes like scalability, modularity, and extensibility.

Overall, the system quality attributes play a critical role in ensuring that computer software systems are effective, reliable, and secure, and meet the needs of their users.
