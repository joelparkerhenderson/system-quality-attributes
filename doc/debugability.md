# Debugability

Debugability: the quality/ability/extent of being debuggable.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain debugability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Debugability is a system quality attribute, which is also considered a non-functional requirement and cross-functional constraint. It refers to the ease of finding and fixing bugs or errors in a software system. Debugability enables developers to identify and correct errors quickly and efficiently, which can save time and reduce costs in the long run.

A system with good debugability is easier to maintain, and issues can be resolved swiftly, reducing downtime, and increasing overall system performance. Debugability is achieved through the use of proper logging and tracing, debugging tools, and automated testing frameworks. It also requires good documentation, well-designed code, and proper error handling.

Debugability is essential for all software systems and is particularly critical for mission-critical applications. It is a fundamental system quality attribute that helps ensure that software is reliable, maintainable, and resilient, providing users with a seamless, error-free experience.

* [Wikipedia: Debugging](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging): In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems. Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling.

* [Dictionary: debug](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/debug): to detect and remove defects from a system, or errors from a computer program.

* [OpenAI: debuggable](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define debuggable (computers and software)">Debuggable refers to a software application or program that is designed to be easily and effectively diagnosed and corrected for any bugs, errors, or problems that may arise during its development or use. It is a quality that allows developers, testers, and system administrators to locate and fix any issues that may occur in the application, ensuring its optimal performance and functionality. Debuggable applications are essential for minimizing downtime, improving user experience, and maintaining the overall health and stability of software systems.</div>
