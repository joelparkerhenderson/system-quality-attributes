# Fault-tolerance

Fault-tolerance: the quality/ability/extent of being fault-tolerant.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain fault-tolerance (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Fault-tolerance is a system quality attribute that denotes a system's ability to continue functioning in the event of a failure or fault in one or more components. 

Fault-tolerance is a non-functional requirement that ensures that a system remains available, reliable, and operational even in the face of hardware, software, or communication failures. Fault-tolerance is a cross-functional constraint that impacts several aspects of system design, including architecture, software design, hardware selection, testing, and fault management.

In essence, fault-tolerance is about ensuring that a system can continue to provide its services despite any failures or interruptions, ensuring that the system remains available and able to serve its users at all times. This requires careful planning and design, including the use of redundant components, error detection and correction mechanisms, and backup systems, among other techniques. The goal is to minimize the impact of potential failures, maintain system integrity, and provide a seamless and reliable user experience.
