# Configurability

**Configurability: the quality/ability/extent of being configurable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain configurability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Configurability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to be easily customized or adapted to meet a specific set of requirements. It is a non-functional requirement that specifies the degree to which a system can be modified to suit different user needs, preferences, and changing environments.

Configurability is a cross-functional constraint that involves several aspects of the system, including its architecture, design, implementation, and maintenance. It requires a system to have a modular and flexible design that allows for the addition or removal of components without affecting other parts of the system.

Configurability is essential for systems that need to adapt to changing business requirements or user preferences. It enables users to tailor the system to their specific needs, reduces development time and cost, and ensures that the system remains relevant and usable over time.

In summary, configurability is a system quality attribute that enables a system to be customized or adapted to meet the changing needs of its users. It is a non-functional requirement that requires a flexible and modular system design and is a cross-functional constraint that impacts different aspects of the system development and maintenance process.

* [Wikipedia: Configurability](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Configurability): The capability of a system for its behavior to be changed by configuration or reconfiguration, e.g. by loading different code. Static configurability distinguishes between configuration time and later run time. Dynamic configurability denotes the capability of a system to be changed while it's running.

* [OpenAI: configurable](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define configurable (computers and software)">Configurable refers to a feature or capability of computer hardware or software that can be easily customized or adjusted according to the user's preferences or requirements. This means that users can modify certain settings or options within the system to meet specific needs, such as changing the language, font size, screen resolution, or input/output devices. Configurable systems are designed to be flexible, adaptable, and user-friendly, allowing users to tailor the system to their specific needs and preferences. Additionally, configurable systems often have a range of pre-built options and settings that can be easily adjusted to match different workflows or use cases.</span>
