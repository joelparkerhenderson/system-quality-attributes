<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain configurability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Configurability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to be easily customized or adapted.  Configurable systems are designed to be flexible, adaptable, and user-friendly. Additionally, configurable systems often have a range of pre-built options that can be easily adjusted to match different use cases. Compare customizability.

Configurability is a non-functional requirement that specifies the degree to which a system can be modified to suit different user needs, preferences, and changing environments. Configurability may involve multiple aspects of the system, including its architecture, design, implementation, and maintenance. It requires a system to have a modular and flexible design that allows for the addition or removal of components without affecting other parts of the system.

Configurability is a cross-functional constraint, especially when stakeholder teams need to adapt to changing business requirements, market forces, or user preferences. High configurability enables stakeholder teams and end-users to tailor the system to their specific needs, which and ensures that the system remains relevant and valuable over time.
