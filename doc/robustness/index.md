# Robustness

Robustness: the quality/ability/extent of being robust.

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain robustness (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Robustness is a system quality attribute that describes the ability of a system to function reliably and efficiently under varying conditions, especially in the face of unforeseen or exceptional events. It is a non-functional requirement that outlines the system's ability to resist and recover from failure, as well as its ability to handle errors and exceptions. 

A robust system should be able to operate under unexpected events such as system overload, network failure, hardware failure, input errors and other unforeseen conditions. It should be able to detect, isolate and isolate errors, and recover from them with minimum impact on the system's performance. 

Robustness is a cross-functional constraint as it affects multiple aspects of the system, including the architecture, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Robustness requires careful consideration of system interactions, dependencies, scalability and fault tolerance, and it is achieved through a combination of redundancy, monitoring, resilience, and fault-tolerance techniques.</span>

* [Dictionary: robust](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/robust): strong and healthy; hardy; vigorous. strong and effective in all or most situations and conditions.

* [OpenAI: robust](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define robust (computers and software)">Robust in the context of computers and software refers to the ability of a system or application to function with a high level of reliability, stability, and resilience under various stress conditions, such as high traffic volume or unexpected errors. A robust system should be able to handle errors and recover from them without crashing, and it should be able to adapt to changing demands or environments without losing performance or functionality. A robust software also should be well-tested, well-documented, and easy to maintain, with clear and well-defined interfaces and error-handling mechanisms.</span>
