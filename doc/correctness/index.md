# Correctness

Correctness: the quality/ability/extent of being correct.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain correctness (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Correctness is a system quality attribute that refers to the accuracy and precision of the system's output or behavior with respect to its intended purpose or specification. It is a non-functional requirement that is crucial for ensuring the reliability, usability, and safety of the system. 

Correctness is a cross-functional constraint that affects multiple aspects of the system, including its functionality, performance, security, and usability. The correctness of a system depends on its ability to handle different input scenarios, detect and handle errors and exceptional conditions, fulfill the user's expectations, and maintain consistency and coherence of its data and behavior.

Achieving correctness requires a systematic and rigorous approach to the system's design, development, testing, and maintenance. It involves identifying and validating the system's requirements, ensuring the completeness and consistency of its design, implementing and testing the system's functionality and behavior, and monitoring and maintaining the system's quality over time.

In summary, correctness is a crucial system quality attribute that ensures the system's accuracy and precision with respect to its intended purpose or specification. It is a non-functional requirement that affects the reliability, usability, and safety of the system and a cross-functional constraint that requires a systematic and rigorous approach to the system's design, development, testing, and maintenance.

* [Wikipedia: Correctness (computer science](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science)): A system is correct with respect to a specification if the system behaves as specified. For example functional correctness refers to the input-output behavior of an algorithm (i.e. for each input it produces an output that satisfies the specification).

* [Dictionary: correctness](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/correctness): conformity to fact or truth; freedom from error; accuracy. the quality of being proper; conformity to an acknowledged or accepted standard. the quality of being just or right in a judgment or opinion.
