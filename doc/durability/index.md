**The quality/ability/extent of being durable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain durability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Durability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to withstand the rigors of use over an extended period of time. It is a non-functional requirement that must be satisfied along with other quality attributes such as performance, reliability, and maintainability. Durability is also a cross-functional constraint that applies to different parts of the system such as hardware, software, and infrastructure.

In general, a durable system is one that can continue to function as expected without experiencing any significant degradation in performance or reliability over time. This requires the use of high-quality materials, components, and design techniques that are resistant to wear, corrosion, and other forms of damage. Additionally, the system must be able to handle the stresses and strains of everyday use without breaking down or developing faults.

Durability is particularly important for systems that are used in high-stress environments such as industrial equipment, transportation systems, and military applications. In these contexts, a failure to meet durability requirements can result in serious consequences such as equipment malfunction, production delays, and even loss of life.

**Define durable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define durable (computers and software)">Durable in the context of computers and software refers to the ability of a device or program to withstand wear and tear, perform consistently over a long period of time, and withstand changes or updates in the technological environment without becoming obsolete. Durable computers and software are designed with reliable components and feature regular maintenance to ensure longevity and avoid data loss or corruption.</span>
