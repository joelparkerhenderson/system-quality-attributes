<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain auditability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Auditability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to provide reliable and accurate data for auditing purposes. Auditability is important in many industries, such as finance, healthcare, and government,  where strict regulations often require auditing of system activities and transactions. Auditability can also help organizations to identify issues and improve processes.

Auditability is a non-functional requirement that is typically also a cross-cutting concern, because a system must be designed with clear and transparent processes that can be easily tracked and recorded, across all functions and modules. The system should store and maintain appropriate logs, records, and metadata that can be used to reconstruct system activities over time; this includes data such as user activity, access logs, transaction records, and system changes. Audit logs can be stored and analyzed to detect security breaches, fraud, data breaches or any other potential risks to the system or organization. 
 
Auditability is a cross-functional constraint, requiring collaboration between various departments such as development, operations, cybersecurity, physical security, legal, compliance, and risk management. The system must be designed with security in mind to ensure that data is not compromised or lost, and compliance regulations are met. It must also be easy to audit, with clear documentation and reporting that can be easily reviewed by auditors or other stakeholders.
