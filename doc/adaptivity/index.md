# Adaptivity

**The quality/ability/extent of being adaptive.**

Adaptivity is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to respond and adapt to changes in its environment or requirements. Compare adaptability and antifragility.

Adaptivity is a non-functional requirement because it doesn't relate to the specific functionality of a system, but rather the system's ability to adapt to changes in its environment, such as an increasing need for system resources, or service degradations in system dependencies.

Examples of postive-oriented adaptivity are autoscaling and elastic clouds, such as when a system can automatically allocate more processing power, memory, storage, bandwidth, and the like.
  
Examples of negative-oriented adaptivity are throttling and backpressure, such as when a system can slow its inbound queues, as well as report the issue to upstream providers, in order to prevent overloading.

Adaptivity is a cross-functional constraint, in practice, because different organization teams have different perspectives on the value of adaptivity, and it can be challenging to understand. As a typical example, a sales team may want a web sales process that is always available, even during peak usage periods that may be ten times higher than normal; this can be solved by the sales team and development team coordination on the adaptivity qualities.

In summary, adaptivity is a critical system quality attribute that enables a system to remain effective and robust in the face of changes and uncertainties. It is essential for systems that operate in complex or dynamic environments and must balance competing requirements and constraints to achieve their objectives.

**Define adaptive:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define adaptive (computers and software)">Adaptive in the context of computers and software refers to the ability of the system to adjust and respond to changing circumstances. Adaptive software is designed to gather information about its usage, and then use that information to modify its own behavior to better meet the system's goals.</span>
