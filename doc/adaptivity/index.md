# Adaptivity

**Adaptivity: the quality/ability/extent of being adaptive. Compare adaptability.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain adaptivity (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Adaptivity is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to respond and adapt to changes in its environment or requirements. It is a non-functional requirement because it doesn't relate to the specific functionality of a system, but rather the system's ability to adapt to changes in its environment.

Adaptivity is a cross-functional constraint because it affects the entire system and all of its components. It is not specific to one function or module but rather affects all aspects of the system's operation.

An adaptive system can adjust to changes in requirements, such as new system needs or changes in the underlying technology. It can also respond to changes in its context, such as network outages or system failures, by adjusting its behavior or configuration to continue to function correctly.

In summary, adaptivity is a critical system quality attribute that enables a system to remain effective and robust in the face of changes and uncertainties. It is essential for systems that operate in complex or dynamic environments and must balance competing requirements and constraints to achieve their objectives.

**Define adaptive:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define adaptive (computers and software)">Adaptive in the context of computers and software refers to the ability of the system to adjust and respond to changing circumstances or user behavior. Adaptive software is designed to gather information about the user's preferences, behavior, and environment, and then use that information to modify its own behavior to better meet the user's needs. Adaptive systems can also learn from their own experiences, making them more intelligent and efficient over time. Examples of adaptive software include personalized search engines, recommendation engines, and chatbots.</span>
