# Adaptivity

**The quality/ability/extent of being adaptive.** 

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain adaptivity (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Adaptivity is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to respond and adapt to changes in its environment or requirements. Compare adaptability and antifragility. Positive-oriented adaptivity examples are autoscaling and elastic clouds, such as when a system can automatically allocate more processing power, memory, storage, bandwidth, and the like. Negative-oriented adaptivity examples are throttling and backpressure, such as when a system can slow its inbound queues, as well as report the issue to upstream providers, in order to prevent overloading.

Adaptivity is a non-functional requirement because it doesn't relate to the specific functionality of a system, but rather the system's ability to adapt to changes in its environment, such as an increasing need for system resources, or service degradations in system dependencies.

Adaptivity is a cross-functional constraint in practice, because different organization teams often have different perspectives on the value of adaptivity. This can be challenging. For example, a sales team may want a website that is always available, even during 100x peak periods, yet this forces significantly different programming approaches. Therefore the sales team and development team must coordinate on the adaptivity constraint.

**Define adaptive:**<span data-chatgpt-prompt="define adaptive (computers and software)">Adaptive refers to the ability of the system to adjust and respond to changing circumstances. Adaptive software is designed to gather information about its usage, and then use that information to modify its own behavior to better meet the system's goals.</span>
