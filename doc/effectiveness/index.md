Effectiveness is a system quality attribute or non-functional requirement that is described as the capability of a system to perform tasks efficiently and accurately, achieving the intended goals or objectives.

Effectiveness is a crucial system quality attribute, as it measures the success of a system in delivering its intended functionality while satisfying user needs and business requirements. The effectiveness of a system is often measured through performance metrics, such as transaction throughput, response time, error rate, and completion rate.

In addition to being a system quality attribute, effectiveness is often considered as a cross-functional constraint, as it is closely related to other quality attributes such as usability, reliability, and security. A system that is not effective in performing its tasks may also suffer from poor usability, unreliable performance, and security vulnerabilities.

Overall, effectiveness is a key system quality attribute that can significantly impact the success of a system in meeting its intended goals and satisfying user needs.
