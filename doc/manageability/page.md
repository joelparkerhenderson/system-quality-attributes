<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain manageability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Manageability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ease and efficiency of managing and administering a system. It is a non-functional requirement that defines the ability of a system to be monitored, configured, and maintained by system administrators or operators.

The manageability attribute is a cross-functional constraint that affects various aspects of a system, including its security, performance, reliability, and scalability. For example, a highly manageable system would have easy-to-use management interfaces, automatic monitoring and alert systems, and self-healing capabilities, which would help to ensure that the system is always available and responsive to user needs.
