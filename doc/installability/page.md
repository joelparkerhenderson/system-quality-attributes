**The quality/ability/extent of being installable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain installability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Installability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ease and simplicity with which a software application can be installed, configured, and deployed on a specific platform or device. It is a non-functional requirement that ensures that an application can be installed and configured quickly and easily, without requiring extensive technical knowledge or expertise.

Installability is a cross-functional constraint that involves multiple stakeholders, including developers, IT operations teams, and end-users. It encompasses factors such as software packaging, system dependencies, installation scripts, user interfaces, and documentation.

In order to achieve high installability, software developers need to prioritize aspects like software modularity, compatibility, and simplicity, which help to streamline the installation and configuration process. Additionally, they need to provide clear and concise installation instructions and user documentation, which help users to get up and running with the software quickly and effectively.

**Define installable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define installable (computers and software)">Installable refers to software or applications that can be installed on a computer or other electronic device. This typically involves downloading or copying software files onto the device, and then running an installation program or wizard to set up the software and configure it for use. Installable software can include programs for productivity, games, utilities, or many other types of computer applications. Some installable software may require specific operating systems or hardware specifications in order to function properly.</span>
