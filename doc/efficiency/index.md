# Efficiency

Efficiency: the quality/ability/extent of being efficient.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain efficiency (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Efficiency refers to the ability of a system to accomplish tasks with minimal waste of resources, such as time, memory, and energy. 

Efficiency is a system quality attribute that describes the extent to which a system can provide optimal performance at a reasonable cost. 

Efficiency is a non-functional requirement that helps to ensure that a system meets its functional requirements while optimizing its performance. 

Efficiency is also a cross-functional constraint that affects different parts of a system, including hardware, software, and human factors. For example, an efficient website must have a fast and reliable server, a well-designed user interface, and optimized code that minimizes the amount of data transmitted over the network. 

Ultimately, an efficient system can help to reduce costs, improve productivity, and enhance user satisfaction. Therefore, it is essential to consider efficiency as a key factor in the design, development, and operation of any system.</div>

* [Dictionary: efficient](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/efficient): performing or functioning in the best possible manner with the least waste of time and effort; having and using requisite knowledge, skill, and industry; competent; capable.

* [OpenAI: efficient](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define efficient (computers and software)">Efficient in the context of computers and software refers to the ability of a system to achieve its intended purpose or complete tasks quickly and accurately without wasting unnecessary resources, such as processing power, memory, or energy. An efficient system is one that can target its resources effectively and complete tasks with maximum speed and minimum waste. An efficient software program is one that is streamlined, performs its functions accurately, and does not consume excessive memory or CPU resources.</div>
