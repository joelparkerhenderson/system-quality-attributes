# Provability

**The quality/ability/extent of being provable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="provability + template">

**Provability** in systems refers to the ability to demonstrate and verify that a system or its components meet specified requirements or properties. It encompasses proving correctness, reliability, and other essential attributes through formal methods, evidence, or validation processes.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, provability is concerned with the system’s ability to provide evidence or formal proofs that it meets its intended specifications and behaves correctly under all expected conditions. This often involves mathematical proofs, formal verification methods, or rigorous testing strategies.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Formal Verification**: Utilizing mathematical proofs or formal methods to verify that the system adheres to its specifications and behaves as intended.
- **Evidence of Correctness**: Providing tangible evidence, such as test results or analysis reports, that supports the system’s adherence to its requirements.
- **Consistency and Completeness**: Ensuring that all aspects of the system’s behavior and requirements are covered and validated.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), provability specifies that the system must be designed and implemented in such a way that its correctness, reliability, and other critical attributes can be formally demonstrated. It emphasizes the need for evidence and assurance of the system’s performance and behavior.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Verification Requirements**: The system should include provisions for formal verification or validation to prove that it meets its requirements.
- **Traceability**: Requirements and their corresponding proofs or evidence should be traceable to ensure that all aspects are addressed.
- **Robust Testing**: The system must support comprehensive testing and validation strategies to provide evidence of its correctness and reliability.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, provability impacts multiple aspects of system development, including design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. It requires that various teams and processes work together to ensure that the system’s properties can be proven and validated.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Design Practices**: Design the system with formal methods and verification techniques in mind to facilitate provability.
- **Documentation and Evidence**: Maintain detailed documentation and evidence of the system’s correctness and performance for verification purposes.
- **Testing and Validation**: Coordinate testing and validation efforts across different teams to ensure comprehensive coverage and evidence of the system’s attributes.

### Implementing Provability

To implement provability:
- **Adopt Formal Methods**: Utilize formal methods, such as theorem proving or model checking, to rigorously verify that the system meets its specifications and behaves correctly.
- **Develop Comprehensive Test Suites**: Create detailed test plans and execute tests to provide evidence of the system’s correctness, performance, and compliance with requirements.
- **Maintain Traceable Documentation**: Document requirements, proofs, and test results thoroughly to ensure that all aspects of the system’s behavior are covered and traceable.
- **Integrate Verification Tools**: Use tools and techniques for formal verification and automated testing to support the provability of the system’s attributes.
- **Collaborate Across Teams**: Ensure that design, development, and testing teams collaborate to address provability requirements and provide evidence of system properties.

**Define provable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define provable (computers and software)">Provable in the context of computers and software refers to being able to demonstrate or verify that a program or system will perform as intended under specified conditions, using mathematical principles and formal methods of analysis. This involves using rigorous mathematical techniques to establish the correctness and reliability of software systems, ensuring that they meet specific functional requirements and behave predictably under all circumstances. Provable software is critical for safety-critical systems, such as aerospace, automotive, medical, and military applications, as well as for ensuring data privacy and security in various domains.</span>
