# Demonstrability

Demonstrability: the quality/ability/extent of being demonstrable.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain demonstrability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Demonstrability is a system quality attribute that represents the ability of a system to demonstrate its functionality and capabilities to its users. It is a non-functional requirement that specifies how well the system can provide evidence or proof of its correct functioning, as well as its ability to trace and reproduce errors and failures.

Demonstrability is also considered as a cross-functional constraint as it influences different aspects of the system development process. It requires collaboration between developers, testers, and subject matter experts to create a system that is easy to demonstrate and validate to different stakeholders.

A system with high demonstrability enables users to interact and verify the system’s behaviors, inputs, and outputs. It involves providing necessary evidence, documentation, and tools to enable users to understand the system’s purpose, operation, and performance.

Overall, demonstrating the system’s functionality and capabilities is essential for ensuring user confidence and trust in the system, and therefore demonstrating this ability is crucial to the success of a system.

* [Dictionary: demonstrate](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/demonstrate): to make evident or establish by arguments or reasoning; prove: to demonstrate a philosophical principle. to describe, explain, or illustrate by examples, specimens, experiments, or the like. to manifest or exhibit; show. to display openly or publicly.

* [OpenAI: demonstrable](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define demonstrable (computers and software)">Demonstrable means capable of being shown or proven with evidence. In the context of computers and software, it refers to a feature or function that can be clearly demonstrated or proven to work as intended. This can involve providing clear documentation, testing, or examples to demonstrate that a particular program, software module, or component meets the requirements or specifications it was designed to satisfy. Demonstrability is an important factor in software development, as it enables developers to verify that their software is functioning correctly and meeting user needs.</div>
