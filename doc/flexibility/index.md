# Flexibility

Flexibility: the quality/ability/extent of being flexible.

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain flexibility (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Flexibility is a system quality attribute that allows a system to adapt and respond to changing requirements, conditions or user needs over time. It ensures that the system can be easily modified, extended or replaced without disrupting the functioning of the system or causing any significant downtime.

Flexibility is also considered as a non-functional requirement as it does not relate to the specific functionality of the system but rather to the way the system is designed to operate. It is often included as part of the system's overall quality requirements and is typically evaluated in terms of the extent to which the system can be easily modified or integrated with other systems or components.

In addition, flexibility is also a cross-functional constraint as it impacts multiple aspects of the system such as its architecture, design, development, testing, maintenance and usability. It requires coordination and collaboration among multiple stakeholders including developers, users, designers, testers, and project managers. Ultimately, flexibility is critical to ensuring that a system remains useful over time and meets evolving business requirements and user needs.</span>

* [OpenAI: flexible](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define flexible (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, "flexible" refers to the ability of a system or program to adapt and adjust to different requirements or changes easily, without significant modifications or disruptions. Flexible systems or software are designed to be easily customizable, configurable or personalized to specific needs, while maintaining their core functionality and performance. This can apply to various aspects such as user interface, data management, processing rules, and integrations with other systems or devices. Flexibility is a desirable characteristic in many applications, especially those that require frequent updates, customization, or scalability.</span>
