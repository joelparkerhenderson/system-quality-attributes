<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain upgradability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Upgradability is a system quality attribute, which is a measure of how well a software system can be modified or enhanced to meet changing needs. It is a non-functional requirement that describes the ease with which a system can be upgraded or updated in terms of hardware, software, or functionality.

Upgradability is a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple aspects of a system, including its design, architecture, and implementation. For example, a system's upgradability may be influenced by its modularity, reusability, compatibility, and scalability.

An upgradable system is desirable because it enables organizations to keep up with changing business requirements, technology advancements, and security threats. In addition, a system that is easy to upgrade can reduce the cost and effort associated with system maintenance, testing, and deployment.

Overall, upgradability is a critical system quality attribute that requires careful consideration during the design and implementation of software systems.
