# Separability

**Separability: the quality/ability/extent of being separable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain separability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Separability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to be divided into modules or components that can be developed, tested, maintained, and replaced independently.

It is also a non-functional requirement that emphasizes the need for a system to have a cohesive architecture that allows for ease of maintenance and modification. Separability enables developers to work on different parts of the system separately, without affecting other components, allowing for better management of code and reducing the complexity of the system.

In addition, separability represents a cross-functional constraint, as it requires collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders. It is an important factor in ensuring that a system is sustainable, adaptable, and scalable. By enabling modular design, separability can also help to reduce costs, reduce risk, and improve quality by allowing for more effective testing and validation of each component.

**Define separable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define separable (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, separable refers to the ability to physically or logically disconnect one component or module from another without affecting the functionality of the remaining parts. This means that different parts of a system can be changed or upgraded without disrupting the operation of other components. Separability is an important design principle that allows for flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of computer systems and software applications.</span>
