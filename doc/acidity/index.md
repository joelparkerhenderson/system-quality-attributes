# ACIDity

**ACIDity: the quality/ability/extent of being ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability).**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain ACID, atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantees reliable processing of database transactions.

* Atomicity refers to the property of a transaction that ensures that either all changes made during the transaction are committed or none at all. If a transaction fails for any reason, all the changes made within it are rolled back, returning the system to its original state.

* Consistency refers to the fact that the system's data state will remain valid before and after a transaction. This means that the rules and constraints defined in the database must be followed consistently.

* Isolation refers to the property that ensures that a transaction runs independently of other transactions. This is important to prevent interference from other transactions and errors that could result from concurrent access to data.

* Durability refers to the property that guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it is permanently saved even in the case of system failures or crashes. 

ACID is a system quality attribute, which is a property or characteristic of a system that describes its overall quality. 

Atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability are cross-functional constraints, as they affect different functional areas of the system. 

Atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability are also considered non-functional requirements, as they describe how the system should behave rather than what it should do.

* [Wikipedia: ACID](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID): ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.[1] In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Together, these properties ensure that the data in a database remains accurate, reliable, and consistent, even when multiple users are accessing and modifying it simultaneously.</span>
