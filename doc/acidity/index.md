# ACIDity

**The quality/ability/extent of being ACID.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="ACIDity (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) + template">

**ACIDity** in the context of systems describes "ACID properties" (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) commonly used in database systems.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, aspects of ACID properties ensure that a system's transactions are processed reliably, maintaining data integrity and consistency. This is crucial for systems that handle transactions, such as databases and financial systems.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all parts of a transaction are completed successfully. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, maintaining system stability.
- **Consistency**: Guarantees that a transaction brings the system from one valid state to another, preserving data integrity.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions are processed independently, without interference, providing a stable environment even when multiple transactions occur simultaneously.
- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the case of a system failure.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), principles akin to ACID properties specify the necessary conditions for reliable transaction processing in a system. These requirements ensure the system can handle transactions correctly and maintain data integrity under various conditions.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Transaction Integrity**: The system must handle transactions in a way that ensures complete and correct processing.
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms must be in place to manage transaction failures and ensure system recovery without data loss.
- **Concurrency Control**: The system must manage multiple transactions simultaneously without conflicts, ensuring data consistency and isolation.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, principles akin to ACID properties impact various aspects of system design, development, and operation, requiring collaboration across multiple teams to ensure reliable transaction processing and data integrity.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Design**: Architects must design the system to support atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable transactions.
- **Development**: Developers must implement transaction management and error handling to adhere to these principles.
- **Testing**: QA teams must rigorously test transaction processing to ensure compliance with ACID-like properties.
- **Operations**: IT operations must monitor transaction processing and handle system failures to maintain durability and consistency.

### Implementing ACID-like Principles

To implement ACID-like principles, several strategies can be employed:
- **Transactional Systems**: Use database systems and software architectures that inherently support ACID properties.
- **Error Handling and Recovery**: Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure atomicity and durability.
- **Concurrency Control Mechanisms**: Use techniques like locking, versioning, and transaction isolation levels to manage concurrency and ensure isolation.
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Regularly perform data integrity checks to ensure consistency.

**Define ACID:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define ACID (computers and software)">ACID refers to a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. These properties ensure that data remains accurate, reliable, and consistent, even when multiple users are simultaneously accessing and modifying data.</span>

* [Wikipedia: ACID](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID): ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.[1] In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.
