# ACIDity

**The quality/ability/extent of being ACID.**

ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties guarantees reliable processing of data transactions.

Atomicity: the property of a transaction that ensures that either all changes made during the transaction are committed or none are. If a transaction fails, then all the changes made within it are rolled back, returning the system to its original state.

Consistency: the fact that the system's data state will remain valid before and after a transaction. The rules and constraints defined in the database must be followed consistently.

Isolation: the property that ensures that a transaction runs independently of other transactions. This it to prevent interference from other transactions or errors due to concurrent access.

Durability: the property that guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it is permanently saved even in the case of system failures or crashes. 

ACIDity is a system quality attribute, which is a property or characteristic of a system that describes its overall quality, especially with regard to databases and transactions.

ACIDity a non-functional requirement, as it describes how the system should behave overall.  For some high scalability systems, ACID is difficult to achieve practically or cost-effectively, and may be superseded by eventual consistency.

ACIDity is typically not an important cross-functional constraint, because in practice many organizations are in favor of  ACID and using it regularly.

**Define ACID:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define ACID (computers and software)">ACID refers to a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. These properties ensure that data remains accurate, reliable, and consistent, even when multiple users are simultaneously accessing and modifying data.</span>

* [Wikipedia: ACID](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID): ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.[1] In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.
