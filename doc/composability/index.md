## Composability

Composability: the quality/ability/extent of being composable.

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain composability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Composability is a system quality attribute, a non-functional requirement, and a cross-functional constraint that determines the degree to which different components or services within an architecture can be combined or composed to create new functionalities or systems without requiring significant changes to the individual components. In other words, composability is the ability of a system or a component to be combined or integrated with other systems or components in a flexible and seamless manner, allowing for easy customization, scalability, and interoperability.

Composability is essential for complex software systems with multiple components or services, as it enables teams to build and maintain systems that are flexible, modular, and easily adaptable to changing requirements. It is also critical for organizations that rely on third-party software components or services, as it ensures that these components can be easily integrated into the organization's existing technology infrastructure.

Overall, composability is a crucial system quality attribute that enables organizations to build and maintain software systems that are scalable, adaptable, and interoperable. It requires careful consideration of the design and architecture of the system, as well as the selection of the appropriate components and services that can be easily integrated and combined to create new functionalities or systems.</span>

* [Wikipedia: Composability](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability): A system design principle that deals with the inter-relationships of components. A highly composable system provides components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.

* [Dictionary: composable](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/composable): to make or form by combining things, parts, or elements. to make up or form the basis of.

* [OpenAI: composable](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define composable (computers and software)">Composable in the context of computers and software refers to the ability of different software components to be deconstructed into smaller, standalone components that can be combined and orchestrated in new ways to create custom applications and services. This approach enables users to rapidly build and deploy applications by combining pre-existing components to meet their specific business needs. Composable architecture is characterized by its ability to create applications that are highly flexible, scalable and can easily accommodate new changes or updates.</span>
