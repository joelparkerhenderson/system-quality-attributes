# Survivability

**The quality/ability/extent of being survivable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain survivability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Survivability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to maintain its critical functionality in the face of various disturbances or threats. It is a non-functional requirement that defines the capacity of a system to operate continuously, effectively and efficiently in the presence of disruptive changes or disruptions.

The goal of survivability is to ensure that the system remains available, secure, and functional even in the event of partial or complete failures or attacks. It is a critical attribute for systems that are involved in mission-critical or operational-critical applications, where the failure of the system can cause significant damage, loss of life or financial penalties.

Survivability is often considered a cross-functional constraint as it involves the consideration of multiple system aspects such as security, availability, reliability, and performance. It requires the involvement of different domains such as security, operations, networking, and software development to jointly evaluate the system requirement, design and provide an adequate level of survivability.

**Define survivable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define survivable (computers and software)">Survivable means having the ability to remain operational even under adverse conditions, such as hardware failures, cyber attacks, or natural disasters. In the context of computers and software, survivability refers to their ability to maintain critical functions or services despite being compromised or under attack. Survivability requires redundancy, fault-tolerance, and proactive security measures to mitigate risks and ensure continuity of operations.</span>
