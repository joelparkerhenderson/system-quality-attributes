# Securability

**The quality/ability/extent of being securable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="securability + template">

**Securability** in systems refers to the ability of a system to protect data, ensure privacy, and maintain the integrity and availability of resources against unauthorized access or attacks. It encompasses various measures and practices to safeguard the system from potential threats and vulnerabilities.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, securability ensures that a system is designed and built to be secure, protecting it from potential threats and vulnerabilities.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data, preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that systems and data are available to authorized users when needed.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), securability defines the requirements for the system to implement security measures, protocols, and practices to safeguard against potential threats.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Access Control**: Implementing mechanisms to control who can access and modify data and system resources.
- **Encryption**: Using encryption to protect data at rest and in transit.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Establishing audit trails and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, securability requires coordination and consideration across different aspects of system development and operation, influencing design, implementation, and maintenance processes.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Design Considerations**: Ensuring security is integrated into the system design from the outset.
- **Operational Practices**: Implementing security best practices in operational procedures, including regular updates and patches.
- **Compliance**: Adhering to relevant security standards, regulations, and best practices.

### Implementing Securability

To implement securability:
- **Security by Design**: Integrate security considerations into the system design phase, ensuring that security measures are built into the architecture.
- **Access Controls**: Implement robust access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), to restrict access to authorized users.
- **Data Encryption**: Use strong encryption protocols to protect data both at rest and in transit, ensuring that sensitive information is safeguarded.
- **Regular Updates and Patches**: Maintain a regular schedule for updating and patching software to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- **Security Training**: Provide ongoing security training and awareness programs for developers, administrators, and users to ensure they understand and follow security best practices.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Implement a vulnerability management program that includes regular scanning, assessment, and remediation of potential security weaknesses.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan to quickly and effectively respond to security incidents, minimizing impact and ensuring swift recovery.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Establish comprehensive logging, auditing, and monitoring practices to detect and respond to potential security breaches in real-time.
- **Compliance and Certification**: Ensure compliance with relevant security standards and regulations, and pursue security certifications to demonstrate commitment to security best practices.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

**Define securable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define securable (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, securable refers to the ability of a system or application to be secured from unauthorized access, tampering or data breaches. This includes implementing security measures such as firewalls, encryption, authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect both the system and the data it contains. A securable system or application is one that is designed and maintained with security in mind, and is resistant to attacks and vulnerabilities.</span>
