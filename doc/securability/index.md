<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain securability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Securability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to protect against unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, or destruction of information or system resources. It is a critical non-functional requirement that ensures the security of a system and is achieved through the implementation of various security controls, such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and audit trails.

Securability is also a cross-functional constraint as it affects multiple aspects of a system, including design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It requires collaboration between different stakeholders, such as developers, system administrators, security analysts, and auditors, to ensure that the system is secure throughout its entire lifecycle.

Overall, securability is a critical system quality attribute that ensures the protection of a system's assets against security threats and risks. It is essential for systems that handle sensitive and confidential information or provide critical services, such as financial transactions, healthcare, and national security.
