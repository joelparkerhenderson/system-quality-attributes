# Precision

Precision: the quality/ability/extent of being precise. Compare accuracy.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain precision (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Precision is a system quality attribute that refers to the level of accuracy and exactness in data, calculations, and outcomes of a system. It is a non-functional requirement that specifies the level of accuracy needed to meet the user's requirements and expectations. Precision is also a cross-functional constraint, as it affects the performance of the system across various business functions, such as finance, engineering, and healthcare.

In a financial system, precision is critical to ensure accurate calculations of amounts, interest rates, and fees. In an engineering system, precision is necessary to ensure accurate measurements, designs, and simulations. In a healthcare system, precision is critical to ensure accurate diagnoses, treatments, and medication dosages.

Precision can be measured using various metrics, such as error rate, variance, and standard deviation. To achieve high precision, a system should have reliable data sources, accurate algorithms and calculations, and robust testing processes.</div>

* [Wikipedia: Precision (computer science)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science))

* [Dictionary: precision](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/precision): Precision. the state or quality of being precise.
accuracy; exactness: to arrive at an estimate with precision. mechanical or scientific exactness: a lens ground with precision.

* [OpenAI: precise](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define precise (computers and software)">Precise in the context of computers and software means to be accurate, exact, and without any deviation or error. In other words, it refers to the ability of a computer system or software to perform tasks with high accuracy, providing output that is consistent and reliable. Precise systems can provide accurate results even in complex situations, where a small mistake could lead to significant errors, making them important in critical applications such as financial transactions, scientific research, and medical diagnosis.</div>
