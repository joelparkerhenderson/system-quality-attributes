# Vertical scalability

**The quality/ability/extent of being scalable within one provider, such as by adding processors, memory, or storage; contrast horizontal scalability.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="vertical scalability + template">

**Vertical scalability** in systems refers to the ability to increase the capacity of a single server or node by adding more resources, such as CPU, memory, or storage, to handle an increased load.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, vertical scalability emphasizes the system's capacity to enhance its performance by upgrading the hardware resources of its existing infrastructure.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Resource Utilization:** Efficient use of additional resources such as CPU, memory, and storage to improve system performance.
- **Performance Improvement:** The ability to achieve significant performance gains by adding more powerful resources.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Balancing the cost of adding resources against the performance benefits obtained.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), vertical scalability specifies the standards and conditions that enable the system to handle increased load through resource augmentation on existing hardware.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Hardware Upgrade Compatibility:** Ensuring that the system can seamlessly integrate new hardware resources without significant reconfiguration or downtime.
- **Software Optimization:** Tuning software to take full advantage of increased hardware resources, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Minimal Downtime:** Implementing strategies to upgrade resources with minimal impact on system availability.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, vertical scalability imposes requirements that affect various aspects of the system, ensuring it can scale up efficiently without compromising other qualities.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Security:** Ensuring that scaling up resources does not introduce new security vulnerabilities or weaken existing security measures.
- **Reliability:** Maintaining system stability and reliability as resources are added, avoiding performance degradation or failures.
- **Compatibility:** Ensuring that all components of the system can support and fully utilize the increased resources.

### Implementing Vertical Scalability

To implement vertical scalability in a system, consider the following steps:
- **Evaluate Current Infrastructure:** Assess the current system architecture and identify potential bottlenecks that can be alleviated with additional resources.
- **Plan for Hardware Upgrades:** Develop a plan for upgrading hardware resources, including identifying compatible components and scheduling upgrades to minimize downtime.
- **Optimize Software Performance:** Tune the software to take full advantage of the increased hardware resources, ensuring that performance gains are realized.
- **Implement Monitoring Tools:** Use monitoring tools to track resource usage and performance, ensuring that additional resources are being utilized effectively.
- **Ensure Compatibility and Integration:** Verify that all system components, including operating systems, applications, and middleware, are compatible with the new hardware resources.
- **Conduct Stress Testing:** Perform stress testing after upgrades to ensure the system can handle increased loads without issues.
- **Plan for Future Scalability:** Establish a roadmap for future scalability needs, ensuring that the system can continue to grow and handle increased demands.

**Define vertical scaling:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define vertical scaling (computers and software)">Vertical scaling refers to the process of increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources, such as RAM, CPU, or storage. This differs from horizontal scaling, which involves adding more servers to handle increased demand. Vertical scaling is often used to improve the performance of applications that require high levels of processing power or memory, and is commonly used in database systems or middleware applications. It is also known as scaling up or upgrading.</span>

* [Wikipedia: Scalability](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability): Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system. In computing, scalability is a characteristic of computers, networks, algorithms, networking protocols, programs and applications. Scaling vertically (up/down) means adding resources to (or removing resources from) a single node, typically involving the addition of CPUs, memory or storage to a single computer.
