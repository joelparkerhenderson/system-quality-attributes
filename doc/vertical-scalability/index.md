# Vertical scalability

**Vertical scalability: the quality/ability/extent of being scalable within one provider, such as by adding processors, memory, or storage.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain vertical scalability
 (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Vertical scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle an increasing workload by adding more resources to a single node or machine, such as adding more CPUs or RAM to a server. It is a system quality attribute, as it defines the ability of the system to function properly under increased workload.

Vertical scalability is also a non-functional requirement, as it is not directly related to the system's functionality, but rather to its performance characteristics. It is a crucial requirement for systems that handle large amounts of data or perform complex computations, as they require more resources to function effectively.

Vertical scalability is also a cross-functional constraint, as it affects multiple areas of the system. It affects the system's performance, capacity, and availability, and requires coordination between the development, operations, and infrastructure teams to implement properly. An efficient and scalable architecture can help ensure that a system can accommodate future growth and provide a reliable user experience.

**Define vertical scaling:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define vertical scaling (computers and software)">Vertical scaling refers to the process of increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources, such as RAM, CPU, or storage. This differs from horizontal scaling, which involves adding more servers to handle increased demand. Vertical scaling is often used to improve the performance of applications that require high levels of processing power or memory, and is commonly used in database systems or middleware applications. It is also known as scaling up or upgrading.</span>

* [Wikipedia: Scalability](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability): Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system. In computing, scalability is a characteristic of computers, networks, algorithms, networking protocols, programs and applications. Scaling vertically (up/down) means adding resources to (or removing resources from) a single node, typically involving the addition of CPUs, memory or storage to a single computer.
