# Horizontal scalability

Horizontal scalability: the quality/ability/extent of being scalable across more load providers, such as by adding more servers and clusters. Contrast vertical scalability.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain horizontal scalability
 (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Horizontal scalability refers to the ability of a system to scale out by adding more instances or nodes to distribute the workload, rather than scaling up by increasing hardware capacity on a single node. It is a system quality attribute that ensures that the system can handle a growing number of users, requests or data size without any significant reduction in performance.

Horizontal scalability is a non-functional requirement that focuses on performance, availability and reliability. A system that can horizontally scale can easily handle high volumes of traffic, data or requests without any downtime or performance degradation. It is a critical requirement for modern web and mobile applications that demand high availability and real-time responsiveness.

Horizontal scalability is also a cross-functional constraint, as it impacts many aspects of a system, including architecture, design, development, deployment, testing, and monitoring. It requires a distributed architecture that can scale horizontally with more instances, load balancing to distribute traffic among instances, data partitioning to manage large datasets across instances, and fault tolerance to deal with instances failures.

In summary, horizontal scalability is a vital quality attribute that ensures a system can handle increasing volumes of traffic and data without losing performance. It is a non-functional requirement that impacts many aspects of a system and is a critical cross-functional constraint for modern web and mobile applications.</div>

* [Wikipedia: Scalability](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability):  Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system. In computing, scalability is a characteristic of computers, networks, algorithms, networking protocols, programs and applications. Scaling horizontally (out/in) means adding more nodes to (or removing nodes from) a system, such as adding a new computer to a distributed software application.

* [OpenAI: simple](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define horizontal scaling (computers and software)">Horizontal scaling is the process of adding more computing resources such as servers, storage devices, or network bandwidth to a system to increase its overall processing capacity. It is a scalability strategy that allows an application or system to handle more workloads and traffic by distributing the workload across multiple servers or nodes, rather than relying on a single larger server. Horizontal scaling is an important feature of modern cloud-based infrastructure, as it allows businesses to easily scale their resources up and down to meet changing demands without disrupting the end-users' experience.</div>
