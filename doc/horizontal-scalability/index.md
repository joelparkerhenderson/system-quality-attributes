# Horizontal scalability

**The quality/ability/extent of being scalable across more load providers, such as by adding more servers and clusters; contrast vertical scalability.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="horizontal scalability + template">

**Horizontal scalability** in systems refers to the ability to increase capacity by adding more nodes or instances to a system, distributing the workload across multiple servers or devices.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, horizontal scalability emphasizes the system's ability to enhance performance and capacity by expanding the number of machines or nodes working together.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Load Distribution:** Efficiently distributing workload across multiple nodes to ensure balanced resource utilization.
- **Elasticity:** The ability to dynamically add or remove nodes based on demand, allowing the system to scale in and out as needed.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Improving the system's ability to handle failures, as the failure of one node does not affect the overall system performance significantly.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), horizontal scalability specifies the standards and conditions that enable the system to handle increased load by adding more nodes or instances.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Cluster Management:** Implementing systems to manage and coordinate multiple nodes, ensuring they work together seamlessly.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensuring data remains consistent and synchronized across all nodes, especially in distributed systems.
- **Network Efficiency:** Optimizing network communication between nodes to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, horizontal scalability imposes requirements that affect various aspects of the system, ensuring it can scale out efficiently without compromising other qualities.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Security:** Ensuring that adding more nodes does not introduce security vulnerabilities and that all nodes adhere to security policies.
- **Reliability:** Maintaining system stability and reliability as new nodes are added, avoiding performance degradation or failures.
- **Interoperability:** Ensuring all nodes can communicate and work together effectively, regardless of their individual configurations.

### Implementing Horizontal Scalability

To implement horizontal scalability in a system, consider the following steps:
- **Design for Distributed Architecture:** Develop the system architecture to support multiple nodes working together, using distributed computing principles.
- **Implement Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic and workloads evenly across all available nodes.
- **Use Containerization and Orchestration:** Leverage containerization technologies (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage and scale node deployments.
- **Ensure Data Synchronization:** Implement mechanisms to keep data consistent across nodes, such as distributed databases or data replication strategies.
- **Monitor and Optimize Performance:** Use monitoring tools to track the performance of individual nodes and the overall system, identifying and addressing bottlenecks.
- **Automate Scaling:** Set up automated scaling policies that add or remove nodes based on predefined metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, or request rates.
- **Test Scalability:** Regularly test the system's scalability by simulating high load scenarios and adding/removing nodes to ensure it can handle dynamic changes effectively.

By focusing on these aspects and steps, systems can achieve effective horizontal scalability, ensuring they can handle increased loads and performance demands by adding more nodes and distributing the workload efficiently.

**Define horizontal scaling:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define horizontal scaling (computers and software)">Horizontal scaling is the process of adding more computing resources such as servers, storage devices, or network bandwidth to a system to increase its overall processing capacity. It is a scalability strategy that allows an application or system to handle more workloads and traffic by distributing the workload across multiple servers or nodes, rather than relying on a single larger server. Horizontal scaling is an important feature of modern cloud-based infrastructure, as it allows businesses to easily scale their resources up and down to meet changing demands without disrupting the end-users' experience.</span>

* [Wikipedia: Scalability](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability):  Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system. In computing, scalability is a characteristic of computers, networks, algorithms, networking protocols, programs and applications. Scaling horizontally (out/in) means adding more nodes to (or removing nodes from) a system, such as adding a new computer to a distributed software application.
