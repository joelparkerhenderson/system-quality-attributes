# Recoverability

**The quality/ability/extent of being recoverable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="recoverability + template">

**Recoverability** in systems refers to the ability of a system to recover from failures and restore itself to a functioning state within a specified time frame, ensuring minimal loss of data and service continuity.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, recoverability focuses on the system's ability to bounce back from failures. It encompasses the procedures, processes, and measures in place to restore functionality and data integrity after a disruption.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Failure Detection**: The system's ability to recognize when a failure has occurred.
- **Data Backup and Restoration**: Regularly backing up data and having efficient methods to restore it.
- **System Redundancy**: Implementing redundant systems or components to take over in case of a failure.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), recoverability defines the expectations and standards for system recovery capabilities. It specifies how quickly and effectively a system should be able to restore operations after a failure.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of time to restore the system after a failure.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.
- **Testing and Validation**: Regularly testing recovery procedures to ensure they meet RTO and RPO requirements.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, recoverability affects multiple aspects of system design, development, and operation. It requires collaboration across various teams to ensure comprehensive recovery planning and implementation.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Collaboration Across Teams**: Involving developers, operations, security, and business continuity teams in recovery planning.
- **Comprehensive Planning**: Developing detailed recovery plans that consider various failure scenarios.
- **Resource Allocation**: Ensuring adequate resources (e.g., personnel, technology) are available for recovery efforts.

### Implementing Recoverability

To implement recoverability, the following steps should be taken:
- **Develop a Recovery Plan**: Create a detailed plan outlining the steps to be taken in case of a failure, including roles and responsibilities.
- **Perform Regular Backups**: Schedule regular backups of critical data and ensure they are stored in secure, easily accessible locations.
- **Conduct Recovery Drills**: Regularly test recovery procedures through drills and simulations to ensure preparedness and identify areas for improvement.

**Define recoverable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define recoverable (computers and software)">Recoverable refers to the ability of computers and software to retrieve lost data or functionality. It means that in case of system failure or malfunction, the data or the system can be restored to its previously functioning state. Data recovery tools are used to recover lost files or information, and system restore points are used to recover a functioning operating system after a crash or critical error. Backup systems and redundancy can also help ensure recoverability in case of data loss or system failure.</span>
