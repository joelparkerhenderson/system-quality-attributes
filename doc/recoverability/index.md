# Recoverability

**Recoverability: the quality/ability/extent of being recoverable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain recoverability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement\)">

Recoverability is a system quality attribute that refers to a system's ability to recover from failures and errors without losing the data or causing disruptions in other parts of the system. It is a non-functional requirement that ensures the system can recover from errors, failures, or crashes promptly, safely, and efficiently.

Recoverability is a crucial and challenging characteristic for any system because failures and errors are not uncommon. The system needs to guard against these failures and errors and recover as soon as possible to ensure users can continue working with minimal downtime. Recoverability sometimes includes features like automated backups, redundancy, and more.

Recoverability is also a cross-functional constraint that influences other system qualities like reliability, maintainability, and availability. It is a critical attribute that must be addressed throughout a system's lifecycle, including design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Therefore, recoverability is a term that traverses through different domains of the software and system architecture and is essential in keeping up with the user requirements, business goals, and technical operations of the system.

It means that in case of system failure or malfunction, the data or the system can be restored to its previously functioning state. Data recovery tools are used to recover lost files or information, and system restore points are used to recover a functioning operating system after a crash or critical error. Backup systems and redundancy can also help ensure recoverability in case of data loss or system failure.</span>
