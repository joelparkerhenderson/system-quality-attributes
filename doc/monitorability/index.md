# Monitorability

**The quality/ability/extent of being monitorable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain monitorability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Monitorability is a system quality attribute that ensures that the system can be monitored and measured to ensure that it is functioning as expected. It is a non-functional requirement that specifies the system's ability to provide feedback, diagnostics, and performance metrics that can be used to identify issues, troubleshoot problems, and optimize its performance.

In addition to being a system quality attribute and non-functional requirement, monitorability is also a cross-functional constraint. It requires collaboration between different teams and departments, including development, operations, and support, to ensure that the necessary monitoring and measurement tools are available and integrated into the system.

The monitorability of a system is critical for maintaining its reliability, availability, and performance. It enables stakeholders to detect and diagnose issues quickly, reduce downtime, and ultimately provide better service to end-users. Therefore, it is essential to include monitorability as a key consideration in the design and development of a system.

**Define monitorable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define monitorable (computers and software)">Monitorable refers to the ability of a computer system or software to be easily observed, tracked, and analyzed for changes or issues. This can include monitoring system performance, network traffic, user activity, and other relevant metrics to ensure the system is operating efficiently and effectively. Essentially, a monitorable system is one that allows for easy monitoring and analysis of its various components and activities.</span>
