# Extensibility

**Extensibility: the quality/ability/extent of being extensible.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain extensibility (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Extensibility is a system quality attribute that represents the system's capacity to extend its functionality or accommodate new features and requirements efficiently. It is a non-functional requirement that describes the ease with which the system can incorporate new functionality without disrupting the existing system's structure or requiring significant changes.

Extensibility is a cross-functional constraint as it impacts various stakeholders involved in the system's development, such as developers, testers, end-users, business analysts, and system administrators. It influences the system's overall architecture, design, and implementation, and affects the system's maintainability, scalability, and adaptability.

In summary, extensibility is an essential system quality attribute that enables a system to incorporate new features and requirements without disrupting existing functionality. It is a non-functional requirement that has cross-functional implications and plays a critical role in the success of a syste.

* [OpenAI: extensible](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define extensible (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, extensible means that a system or program is designed in a way that allows it to be easily enhanced or modified with new features or functionalities without requiring significant changes to the underlying code or architecture. An extensible system typically provides mechanisms such as APIs (application programming interfaces), plugins, or scripts that developers can use to extend its capabilities and integrate it with other systems, tools, or platforms. This flexibility and adaptability make extensible systems and software ideal for various applications, from complex enterprise systems to consumer applications and mobile apps.</span>
