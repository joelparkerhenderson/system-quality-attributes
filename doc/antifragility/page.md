# Antifragility

**The quality/ability/extent of being antifragile.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain antifragility (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Antifragility is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to thrive and improve under stress, shock, or change, instead of just surviving it. It is a property of systems that have the ability to constantly adapt and grow stronger in the face of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity of their environment.  Compare self-sustainability.

Antifragility is a non-functional requirement that typical relates to the resilience, reliability, and robustness of a system. It defines the system's ability to withstand unexpected or unforeseen changes in its environment, mitigate risks and failures, and recover quickly from any disruption. Antifragility goes very well with testing via chaos engineering.

Antifragility can be a cross-functional constraint, and in practice is a hallmark of progressive leading-edge organizations, because it impacts various aspects of a system, such as its design, architecture, operations, maintenance, and security. Antifragility requires strong collaboration of different teams and disciplines, such as development, testing, operations, security, and business, to ensure that the system is built, deployed, and managed in a way that enhances its antifragile properties.

**Define antifragile:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define antifragile (computers and software)">Antifragile is a term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book "Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder." It describes a system or entity that becomes stronger and more resilient when exposed to stressors or adversity, as opposed to simply withstanding them or breaking under the pressure.

In the context of computer systems and software, being antifragile means designing and building systems that are able to adapt and recover quickly from unexpected failures, errors, or attacks. It also involves creating redundancy, backup and recovery mechanisms, and automated self-healing processes that can mitigate the impact of disruptions.

Antifragile computer systems and software enable organizations to become more resilient to unforeseen events, maintain business continuity, and deliver a better user experience. They also benefit from continuous improvements and learning from past failures, incorporating insights to enhance security, performance, and reliability.
