# Fidelity

**Fidelity: the quality/ability/extent of having fidelity. <!-- TODO -->**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain fidelity (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Fidelity is a system quality attribute that refers to the degree of accuracy and exactness with which a system or its components perform their intended functions or tasks. It is concerned with the system's ability to correctly represent, store, retrieve, and process data or information, as well as its capacity to provide consistent and reliable results. High-fidelity systems are generally more reliable, accurate, and trustworthy, whereas low-fidelity systems are prone to errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies.

Fidelity is also a non-functional requirement that specifies the system's performance and behavior characteristics that cannot be directly related to its primary functions or features. It includes aspects such as reliability, availability, maintainability, and usability, which are important for ensuring that the system can be effectively used and operated by its users.

Finally, fidelity can be regarded as a cross-functional constraint, as it affects all aspects of the system design and development process, including software engineering, hardware engineering, user experience design, testing, and maintenance. A system that lacks fidelity may lead to significant performance issues, user frustration, and maintenance challenges, making it crucial for designers and developers to incorporate fidelity considerations into all aspects of the system design and development process.

**Define fidelity:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define fidelity (computers and software)">Fidelity refers to the degree of accuracy, reliability, and faithfulness in reproducing or representing data, graphics, or sound in digital form. It is used to describe the quality of the output from software or hardware devices such as monitors, speakers, printers, and graphics cards. High fidelity means that the output accurately represents the original input or source material, with minimal loss of detail or distortion. In the context of digital audio, fidelity is also referred to as the quality of the sound and the absence of any noise or distortion. High-fidelity sound is often associated with high-quality audio equipment and the use of lossless or uncompressed digital audio formats.</span>
