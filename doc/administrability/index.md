<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain administrability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Administrability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ease with which a system can be managed and maintained by system administrators or operators. It is also considered a non-functional requirement as it focuses on how the system should perform rather than what it should do. Administrability is a cross-functional constraint because it affects the entire system and requires collaboration between different roles such as developers, testers, and administrators.

An administrable system is one that allows administrators to perform tasks such as configuration, deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting with ease. An administrable system is important because it reduces the time and resources required for administration, increases system reliability and availability, and improves user satisfaction.

To enhance administrability, a system should be designed with features such as user-friendly interfaces, clear documentation, automated processes, efficient logging and reporting, and effective security controls. Additionally, system administrators should be involved in the development process from the start to identify potential issues and ensure that the system is designed with manageability in mind.

In summary, administrability is a critical system quality attribute that ensures that the system can be managed and maintained efficiently, making it important for ensuring system reliability, availability, and high user satisfaction.
