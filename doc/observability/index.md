**The quality/ability/extent of being observable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain observability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Observability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of the system to be easily monitored and measured, allowing for timely detection and resolution of issues. It is a non-functional requirement that ensures the system's readiness for debugging, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

Observability also serves as a cross-functional constraint, as it impacts teams responsible for different aspects of the system, such as development, operations, and customer support. It requires collaboration among these teams to ensure that the necessary logs, metrics, and other monitoring tools are in place and accessible to all stakeholders.

**Define observable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define observable (computers and software)">Observable in the context of computers and software refers to a property or state of a piece of code or an application that can be easily monitored or measured through some sort of instrumentation or tooling. This can include things like performance metrics, error logs, and other output that can be easily tracked and analyzed by developers and system administrators. The ability to observe the behavior of a system or application is critical for identifying and resolving any issues or inefficiencies that arise, and for optimizing overall system performance.</span>
