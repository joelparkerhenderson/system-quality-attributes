# Observability

**The quality/ability/extent of being observable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="observability + template">

**Observability** in systems refers to the ability to infer the internal states and behavior of a system by examining its outputs, such as logs, metrics, and traces. It enables understanding and diagnosing the system's performance and issues in real-time.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, observability ensures that the system's internal state can be effectively monitored and understood from the outside, leading to better management and troubleshooting capabilities.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Instrumentation**: Embedding code within the system to collect relevant data on operations, performance, and errors.
- **Correlation**: Connecting different pieces of data to provide a coherent view of system behavior and performance.
- **Visualization**: Presenting collected data in an accessible and actionable format, typically through dashboards and reports.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), observability specifies the standards and practices for making the system transparent and understandable through data collection and analysis.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Data Collection**: Gathering detailed logs, metrics, and traces from various components of the system.
- **Data Analysis**: Tools and processes for analyzing collected data to derive meaningful insights about the systemâ€™s performance and health.
- **Alerting and Notification**: Configuring alerts based on data analysis to notify relevant stakeholders of potential issues.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, observability affects various aspects of system design, development, and operations, requiring collaboration across different teams to ensure the system is observable.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Standardization**: Implementing consistent practices and tools across teams for data collection and analysis.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring observability tools and practices can scale with the system as it grows.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrating observability tools with the system's architecture and other operational tools.

### Implementing Observability

To implement observability:
- **Implement Instrumentation**: Embed instrumentation code in the system to collect logs, metrics, and traces. Use frameworks like OpenTelemetry or Prometheus.
- **Standardize Data Formats**: Ensure that data collected from different parts of the system adheres to standardized formats for easier analysis and correlation.
- **Deploy Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like Grafana, Kibana, or Datadog for real-time data visualization and analysis.
- **Set Up Automated Alerts**: Configure automated alerting systems based on predefined thresholds or anomaly detection to notify stakeholders of potential issues.
- **Create Comprehensive Dashboards**: Develop dashboards that provide a unified view of logs, metrics, and traces, enabling quick diagnosis and troubleshooting.
- **Conduct Regular Audits**: Regularly review and audit observability practices and tools to ensure they are comprehensive and effective.
- **Train Teams**: Provide training to development and operations teams on best practices for implementing and using observability tools.
- **Automate Processes**: Automate the deployment and configuration of observability tools to ensure consistency and reduce manual efforts.
- **Perform Load Testing**: Conduct regular load testing to understand the system's behavior under different conditions and ensure observability tools can handle the volume of data generated.
- **Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines**: Incorporate observability checks and validations within CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early in the development process.

**Define observable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define observable (computers and software)">Observable in the context of computers and software refers to a property or state of a piece of code or an application that can be easily monitored or measured through some sort of instrumentation or tooling. This can include things like performance metrics, error logs, and other output that can be easily tracked and analyzed by developers and system administrators. The ability to observe the behavior of a system or application is critical for identifying and resolving any issues or inefficiencies that arise, and for optimizing overall system performance.</span>
