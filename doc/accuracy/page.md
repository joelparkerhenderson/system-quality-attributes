# Accuracy

**The quality/ability/extent of being accurate. Compare precision.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain accuracy (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Accuracy is a system quality attribute that refers to producing results that are exactly the expected value, or very close to it. Accurate systems provide reliable and trustworthy results, and may also enhance user confidence and satisfaction. Accuracy measures how closely the output of the system matches the expected output. Accurate results are essential in systems where decisions are based on the output, such as financial, medical, or safety-critical systems.

Accuracy is a non-functional attribute that is often linked with other system quality attributes such as completeness, consistency, and correctness, and is related to factors such as data quality, input validation, and error handling. This includes verifying data inputs, detecting and handling errors, validating algorithms and calculations, and establishing quality control mechanisms. 

Accuracy is a cross-functional constraint because it requires careful design, testing, and validation, with collaboration among stakeholder teams such as business analysis and subject-matter experts (SMEs). Accuracy may have legal, contractual, and financial implications, thus involving an organization's lawyers, compliance officers, and risk management planners.

**Define accurate:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define accurate (computers and software)">Accurate refers to the ability of computers and software systems to produce results that are free from errors or discrepancies and are very close to the true or expected value. In other words, accuracy is the degree of conformity of the output of a system to the correct or expected value. It is a critical measure of the reliability and effectiveness of computer-based systems, as accurate information is essential for decision-making, analysis, and other important tasks. The accuracy of a system depends on various factors, including the precision of the algorithms used, the quality of the data input, and the limitations of the hardware being used.</span>
