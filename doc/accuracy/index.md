# Accuracy

Accuracy: the quality/ability/extent of being accurate. Compare precision.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain accuracy (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Accuracy is a system quality attribute, which refers to the degree to which the system produces correct and reliable results. It measures how closely the output of the system matches the expected output. In the context of software development, accuracy is a non-functional requirement, which means that it does not specify a particular function or feature of the system, but rather describes how well the system performs its functions or features.

Accuracy is a cross-functional constraint, as it affects many aspects of the system and depends on the interplay of various components and processes. It is often linked with other system quality attributes such as completeness, consistency, and correctness, and is related to factors such as data quality, input validation, and error handling. Accurate results are essential in systems where decisions are based on the output, such as financial, medical, or safety-critical systems.

Ensuring accuracy in a system requires careful design, testing, and validation. This includes verifying data inputs, detecting and handling errors, validating algorithms and calculations, and establishing quality control mechanisms. Accurate systems not only provide reliable and trustworthy results but also enhance user confidence and satisfaction.

* [Wikipedia: Accuracy](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy): In a set of measurements, accuracy is closeness of the measurements to a specific value, while precision is the closeness of the measurements to each other; ISO calls this trueness.

* [Dictionary: accurate](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/accurate): Free from error or defect; consistent with a standard, rule, or model; precise; exact. careful or meticulous.

* [OpenAI: accuracy](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define accuracy (computers and software)">Accurate refers to the ability of computers and software systems to produce results that are free from errors or discrepancies and are very close to the true or expected value. In other words, accuracy is the degree of conformity of the output of a system to the correct or expected value. It is a critical measure of the reliability and effectiveness of computer-based systems, as accurate information is essential for decision-making, analysis, and other important tasks. The accuracy of a system depends on various factors, including the precision of the algorithms used, the quality of the data input, and the limitations of the hardware being used.</div>
