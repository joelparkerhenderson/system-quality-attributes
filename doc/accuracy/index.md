# Accuracy

**The quality/ability/extent of being accurate. Compare precision.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain accuracy (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Accuracy is a system quality attribute, which refers to the degree to which the system produces correct and reliable results. It measures how closely the output of the system matches the expected output. Accurate systems provide reliable and trustworthyresults and may also enhance user confidence and satisfaction.

Accuracy is a non-functional requirement, and affects many aspects of the system and depends on the interplay of various components and processes. It is often linked with other system quality attributes such as completeness, consistency, and correctness, and is related to factors such as data quality, input validation, and error handling. Accurate results are essential in systems where decisions are based on the output, such as financial, medical, or safety-critical systems.

Accuracy is a cross-functional constraint, ensuring accuracy in a system requires careful design, testing, and validation, with collaboration among stakeholder teams such as business analysis and subject-matter experts (SMEs). This includes verifying data inputs, detecting and handling errors, validating algorithms and calculations, and establishing quality control mechanisms. Accuracy may have legal, contractual, and financial implications, thus involving an organization's lawyers, compliance officers, and risk management planners.

**Define accurate:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define accurate (computers and software)">Accurate refers to the ability of computers and software systems to produce results that are free from errors or discrepancies and are very close to the true or expected value. In other words, accuracy is the degree of conformity of the output of a system to the correct or expected value. It is a critical measure of the reliability and effectiveness of computer-based systems, as accurate information is essential for decision-making, analysis, and other important tasks. The accuracy of a system depends on various factors, including the precision of the algorithms used, the quality of the data input, and the limitations of the hardware being used.</span>
