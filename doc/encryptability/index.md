# Encryptability

**Encryptability: the quality/ability/extent of being encryptable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain encryptability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Encryptability refers to the capability of a system to secure sensitive data by utilizing encryption methods. In technical terms, encryption is the procedure of transforming plain text data into an unreadable form that can only be decoded with the help of a unique cryptographic key.

Encryptability is a system quality attribute since it is concerned with the system's capability to preserve data confidentiality and integrity. It ensures that data remains secure during transmission and storage, thereby providing protection against unauthorized access, disclosure, or tampering.

Encryptability is also a non-functional requirement, meaning that it specifies how a system should perform rather than defining a specific feature. It is a critical requirement in many systems, especially those associated with sensitive information such as payment processing, medical records, or government data.

In addition, encryptability can be considered as a cross-functional constraint, as it may affect various aspects of a system, including performance, usability, and maintainability. Encryption processes may impact system performance by adding overhead in terms of processing power and resources. However, this overhead may be outweighed by the benefits of data security.

In summary, encryptability is a critical system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, and cross-functional constraint that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.

* [Wikipedia: Encryption](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption): In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.

This feature is crucial in computers and software to ensure secure communication, data protection, and privacy. Encryptable data can only be accessed with a decryption key or password, making it challenging for hackers or cybercriminals to read or manipulate the information.</span>
