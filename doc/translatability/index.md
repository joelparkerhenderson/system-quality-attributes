# Translatability

**The quality/ability/extent of being translatable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="translatability + template">

**Translatability** in systems refers to the ability of the system to support multiple languages and adapt to different cultural contexts without requiring extensive rework. This encompasses both the user interface and the underlying data.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, translatability ensures that a system can be easily adapted for use in different languages and cultural contexts, thereby expanding its usability and accessibility to a global audience.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: The design and development of the system in such a way that it can easily be adapted to various languages and regions without requiring engineering changes.
- **Localization (l10n)**: The actual adaptation of the system for specific regions or languages, including translating text and adjusting formats for dates, times, and currency.
- **User Interface Flexibility**: Ensuring that the UI can accommodate different lengths of text and other localization requirements without breaking the layout or design.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), translatability specifies the need for the system to support different languages and regional settings, making it accessible and usable for a diverse user base.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Language Support**: The system must support multiple languages, including those with different character sets (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese characters).
- **Cultural Adaptation**: The system must be able to adapt to different cultural norms and practices, such as date formats, address formats, and right-to-left text.
- **Translation Management**: The system should include tools and processes for managing translations, including version control and consistency checks.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, translatability impacts multiple aspects of system development and maintenance, requiring coordinated efforts across different teams and stakeholders.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Content Management**: Ensuring that all user-facing content can be easily translated and managed, often involving content management systems (CMS) that support multilingual content.
- **Development Practices**: Adopting coding practices that separate code from content, allowing for easier translation and localization.
- **Quality Assurance**: Implementing QA processes that include testing for different languages and cultural settings to ensure the system works correctly across all supported locales.

### Implementing Translatability

To implement translatability:
- **Adopt Internationalization Practices**: Ensure that the system's design and development practices follow internationalization principles from the outset, such as using Unicode and externalizing all text.
- **Use Localization Tools**: Employ tools and platforms that support localization, such as translation management systems and libraries for handling multiple languages.
- **Design Flexible UI**: Create a user interface that can adapt to different text lengths and reading directions without breaking the layout.
- **Develop a Translation Workflow**: Establish a clear workflow for translating content, including steps for translation, review, and integration into the system.
- **Engage Local Experts**: Involve native speakers and local experts in the translation process to ensure cultural relevance and accuracy.
- **Conduct Comprehensive Testing**: Test the system in all supported languages and locales to identify and fix issues related to translation and localization.
- **Regularly Update Translations**: Maintain and update translations as the system evolves and as new content is added, ensuring that all versions remain consistent and accurate.
