<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain translatability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Translatability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to be easily translated or localized for different languages, cultures, and regions. To achieve translatability, a system should use standard encoding and character sets, support internationalization and localization features, and provide clear documentation and resources for translators and localizers.

A translatable system can help reach a wider audience and be more accessible to users from different backgrounds. It is especially important for systems that are intended for use in multiple regions or that need to support a diverse user base. By providing support for multiple languages and cultures, a system can reduce the risk of misunderstandings and errors caused by language and cultural differences, and ultimately improve the user experience.


Translatability is a non-functional requirement that specifies the system's ability to support multiple languages, character sets, and cultural conventions.

Translatability can also be a cross-functional constraint, as it requires collaboration between different functional areas, such as development, design, and localization, to ensure that the system can be easily translated and localized. It is also important for ensuring the system's usability, as it can reduce the risk of misunderstandings and errors caused by language and cultural differences.
