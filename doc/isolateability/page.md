# Isolateability

**The quality/ability/extent of being isolatable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain isolateability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Isolateability is a system quality attribute, which refers to the degree to which a system's components can be tested or modified in isolation, without impacting the rest of the system. In other words, it is the ability of a system component to function independently of other components.

Isolateability is also a non-functional requirement, which specifies the conditions that a system must meet regarding its performance, security, reliability, and other qualities that cannot be directly observed by users.

In addition, isolateability can also be considered as a cross-functional constraint, as it affects multiple aspects of the system design, including testing, maintenance, and scalability. It is essential to design systems with high isolateability to reduce the risk of system failures and improve maintainability.

**Define isolatable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define isolatable (computers and software)">Isolatable refers to the ability to separate or isolate a particular component, system, or application from the rest of the computer or software environment in a way that it can be tested, modified, or debugged independently. This separation allows developers to identify and fix issues without affecting other parts of the system, making it easier to maintain and update the software. Isolatable components are often designed to function seamlessly with other parts of the system, but can also be effectively isolated when necessary.</span>
