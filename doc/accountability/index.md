# Accountability

Accountability: the quality/ability/extent of being accountable. 

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain accountability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Accountability refers to the ability of a system to have clear identification and tracking of responsibilities, actions, and outcomes related to a system or process. It is a system quality attribute that assesses the reliability and trustworthiness of a system, as it ensures that individuals or entities involved in a given process are responsible and answerable for their actions or decisions. 

As a non-functional requirement, accountability sets expectations for the performance and security of a system, specifying that it must provide clear records and audit trails, access controls, and other measures that mitigate the risk of fraud, corruption, or errors. In other words, it is not a feature that users directly interact with but describes the underlying behavior and security of the system. 

Finally, accountability can also be considered a cross-functional constraint, as it affects several aspects of a system's design and operation, such as governance, risk management, compliance, and legal requirements. It often involves collaboration and alignment between different stakeholders, including developers, administrators, auditors, and users, and may require specific policies, procedures, or tools to ensure its proper implementation.</span>
