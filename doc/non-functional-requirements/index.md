# Non-functional requirements (NFRs)

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) refer to the characteristics or qualities of software that do not relate to its specific functionality. These requirements represent the quality attributes of a system and define its overall aspects such as performance, scalability, reliability, usability, accessibility, maintainability, and more.

Examples:

* Performance: The system should carry out tasks within an expected response time, resource utilization, and throughput rate.

* Scalability: The system should handle increasing amounts of users, data, and tasks, while maintaining its performance.

* Reliability: The system should be working well enough, even when showing indications of deteriorating performance.

* Usability: This system should provide user interfaces and user experiences that help end-users succeed.

* Accessibility: The system should work well for people with disabilities, and also satisfy legal and ethical obligations.

* Maintainability: The system should be easily accessible for maintenance, and also maintenance costs should be low.

Non-functional requirements are critical to ensure the success of the system. By including non-functional requirements in the software development process, businesses can ensure that their software meets the expectations of stakeholders and end-users.
