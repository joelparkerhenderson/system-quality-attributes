# Instrumentability

Instrumentability: the quality/ability/extent of being instrumentable.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain instrumentability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Instrumentability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ease with which a system can be monitored and diagnosed for errors or malfunctions. It is a non-functional requirement that specifies how well a system can be managed, maintained, and troubleshooted by administrators and end-users. It is also a cross-functional constraint that affects several aspects of a system's design and implementation, including its architecture, interfaces, protocols, and data formats.

Instrumentability is important for systems that are critical to business operations, security, compliance, or performance. The ability to instrument a system means that it can be monitored in real-time, logged for historical analysis, and audited for compliance with regulations, standards, and policies. Good instrumentability means that administrators and users can quickly identify problematic areas, diagnose root causes, and perform remedial actions without disrupting the system or causing further issues.

From a design perspective, instrumentability requires that a system is designed with sufficient visibility, controllability, and testability. This may involve integrating instrumentation hooks, diagnostic probes, and logging mechanisms into the system's architecture, as well as providing configurable settings, administrative interfaces, and debugging tools. Instrumentation also requires that the system's performance and behavior are well-defined and predictable, so that meaningful metrics can be collected and analyzed over time.

In summary, instrumentability is a system quality attribute that ensures that a system can be easily monitored, diagnosed, and maintained. It is essential for systems that need to meet certain standards, regulatory requirements or business objectives. It is a non-functional requirement that must be considered during system design and implementation, and it imposes cross-functional constraints on the system's architecture, interfaces, protocols, and data formats.</div>

* [Wikipedia: Instrumentation (computer programming)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(computer_programming): In the context of computer programming, instrumentation refers to the measure of a product's performance, in order to diagnose errors and to write trace information. Instrumentation can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation. Output can include profiling that measures dynamic program behaviors during a training run with a representative input, or inserting timers into functions, or logging major events such as crashes, etc.

* [Dictionary: instrumentation](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/instrumentation): the science of developing, manufacturing, and utilizing instruments, especially those used in science and industry.

* [OpenAI: instrumentable](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define instrumentable (computers and software)">An instrumentable system exposes a set of internal metrics and statistics that can be collected, analyzed and visualized by various tools. This allows developers and operators to identify issues or bottlenecks, make informed decisions, and optimize the system's behavior. Instrumentation is a crucial aspect of modern monitoring and observability solutions.</div>
