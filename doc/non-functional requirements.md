# Non-functional requirements (NFRs)

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) refer to the characteristics or qualities of software that do not relate to its specific functionality. These requirements represent the quality attributes of a system and define its overall performance, reliability, security, usability, and maintainability. Non-functional requirements include aspects such as performance, scalability, reliability, security, usability, accessibility, maintainability, and availability. 

1. Performance: This refers to the ability of the software to carry out tasks within a given timeframe, memory, and processing power. Performance requirements can have different metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization.

2. Scalability: This refers to the ability of the system to handle increasing amounts of users, data and transactions while maintaining its performance. 

3. Reliability: The system must meet the reliability expectations of the user, meaning that it should be available and working well over a specified period, even when functioning in failsafe mode or when showing indications of deteriorating performance. 

4. Security: It is important to establish a secure application using confidentiality, integrity and availability to prevent all unauthorized access, data modification, data loss or breaches. 

5. Usability: This refers to the ease of use of a system, its compatibility with various interfaces, and how it feels to use. This can be emphasized around various kinds of audiences, like beginners, experts and everyone in between.

6. Accessibility: In order to satisfy legal and ethical obligations, the system must consider people with disabilities and provide them with equal opportunities to interact with the system. 

7. Maintainability: The software should be easily accessible for maintenance and the cost of system maintenance should be kept low over the software development life cycle.

8. Availability: This defines the amount of time when the system is operational and can be used by users. It also includes the ability to operate the system at all times or with a minimum amount of downtime during maintenance. 

Non-functional requirements are critical to ensure the success of the software in terms of performance, reliability, security, and usability. By including non-functional requirements in the software development process, businesses can ensure that their software meets the expectations of stakeholders and end-users alike.
