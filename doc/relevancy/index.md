# Relevancy

**Relevancy: the quality/ability/extent of being relevant.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain relevancy (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Relevancy, in the context of software development, refers to the degree to which a system meets the user's needs, expectations, and goals. Relevancy is essential in developing high-quality software that fulfills the intended purpose and satisfies the stakeholders. Depending on the perspective, relevancy can be seen as a system quality attribute, a non-functional requirement, or a cross-functional constraint.

As a system quality attribute, relevancy measures the degree to which a system is fit for its intended use. It considers whether the system's features and functionalities are relevant to its users, whether its outputs provide value to the business, and whether it supports the organization's goals and strategies. A system that lacks relevancy may be difficult to use, lack user adoption, or fail to meet the desired business outcomes.

As a non-functional requirement, relevancy defines the quality attributes that quantify the system's ability to meet its user needs, such as usability, efficiency, and effectiveness. User feedback and observation may help in determining the necessary non-functional requirements that support relevancy. For example, the system may need to be responsive and fast, error-free, secure and scalable, and allow for seamless integration with other software or hardware tools.

As a cross-functional constraint, relevancy influences how different parts of the system interoperate and affects the overall software architecture. It considers the necessary trade-offs when different stakeholders have different goals or infrastructural constraints such as resource limitations. The design and development team may need to ensure that the system is adaptable to different user scenarios, locations, and usage demands.

In summary, relevancy is a critical concept in software development that ensures that the system meets the user's needs, expectations, and goals. It is a system quality attribute, a non-functional requirement, and a cross-functional constraint that affects the software development process from design to implementation and maintenance.

**Define relevant:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define relevant (computers and software)">Relevant, in the context of computers and software, refers to something that is significant or applicable to a particular situation or purpose. It can refer to data, information, features, or functions that are useful or necessary for achieving a specific task or goal. Relevant information or features are considered valuable because they directly contribute to the effectiveness or efficiency of the task or goal at hand. In order to determine if something is relevant, it is important to consider the context, goals, and requirements of the situation or task.</span>
