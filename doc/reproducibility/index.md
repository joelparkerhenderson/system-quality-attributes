# Reproducibility

**Reproducibility: the quality/ability/extent of being reproducable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain reproducibility (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement\)">

Reproducibility is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to produce consistent and accurate results when the same input is provided multiple times. It is a non-functional requirement that is essential for scientific research, particularly in fields that rely on experimental data analysis. 

From a cross-functional perspective, reproducibility is considered a constraint that affects various stakeholders involved in the development and implementation of a system. It imposes requirements on the design, implementation, testing, and maintenance of the system, and requires collaboration between different teams to ensure that the system meets the necessary standards for reproducibility.

Reproducibility is important because it enhances the reliability and credibility of scientific research and enables scientists to verify and validate their findings. It also promotes transparency and accountability in research, as it allows others to replicate and evaluate the methodology and results of a study.

* [OpenAI: reproducable](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define reproducable (computers and software)">In the context of computers and software, "reproducible" refers to the ability to recreate a specific outcome or result consistently and reliably, typically in the same computing environment, with the same input data, and using the same software settings and configurations. Reproducibility is important for ensuring the accuracy and validity of scientific experiments and computational analyses, as well as for troubleshooting and debugging technical issues. To achieve reproducibility, developers or researchers may document their methods and code, use version control systems, and apply standardization and automation practices.</span>
