Accessibility is a system quality attribute that refers to people with disabilities or special needs being able to effectively use a system. Accessibility helps accommodate a diverse user base and helps promote inclusivity. Accessibility typically includes a system's ability to provide alternative input and output mechanisms, such as voice commands or text-to-speech, as well compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers and Braille displays.

Accessibility is a non-functional requirement for consideration when designing and developing systems and applications that are accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility is a mandatory governmental legal requirement for websites and applications in many jurisdictions.

Accessibility is a cross-functional constraint because it requires collaboration between designers, developers, and quality assurance teams to ensure that the system meets accessibility standards and guidelines, and complies with company policies and governmental laws.
