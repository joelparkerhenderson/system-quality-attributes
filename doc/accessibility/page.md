**Accessibility** refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments so they are usable by people with the widest range of abilities. In the context of systems, accessibility ensures that applications can be effectively used by everyone, including people with disabilities.

As a **system quality attribute**, accessibility defines how well a system can be used by individuals with diverse abilities, ensuring inclusivity.

As a **non-functional requirement**, accessibility specifies the conditions under which the system must operate to be considered accessible. It defines the system's ability to support users with disabilities.

As a **cross-functional constraint**, accessibility impacts various aspects of system design and development, requiring collaboration across multiple teams to ensure a cohesive and comprehensive approach.

To **implement**, accessibility key aspects are guideline adherence, user research, assistive technologies, and inclusive design.
