# Accessibility

**The quality/ability/extent of being accessible.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="accessibility + template">

**Accessibility** refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments so they are usable by people with the widest range of abilities. In the context of systems, accessibility ensures that applications can be effectively used by everyone, including people with disabilities.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, accessibility defines how well a system can be used by individuals with diverse abilities, ensuring inclusivity.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Usability**: Ensures that people with varying levels of ability can use the system effectively and efficiently.
- **Inclusivity**: Supports diverse user needs, making technology available to all, regardless of physical, cognitive, or sensory impairments.
- **Compliance**: Adherence to accessibility standards and guidelines such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), accessibility specifies the conditions under which the system must operate to be considered accessible. It defines the system's ability to support users with disabilities.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Perceivability**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive, e.g., through screen readers or text alternatives for images.
- **Operability**: User interface components and navigation must be operable by all users, e.g., through keyboard navigation or voice commands.
- **Understandability**: Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable, e.g., through simple language and clear instructions.
- **Robustness**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, accessibility impacts various aspects of system design and development, requiring collaboration across multiple teams to ensure a cohesive and comprehensive approach.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Design**: Designers must create interfaces that consider accessibility from the outset, incorporating features like color contrast, text size options, and intuitive layouts.
- **Development**: Developers must implement code that supports accessibility features, such as semantic HTML, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks, and keyboard accessibility.
- **Testing**: Testers must conduct accessibility testing using tools like screen readers and automated accessibility checkers, as well as manual testing with diverse user groups.
- **Content Creation**: Content creators must ensure that all multimedia and text content is accessible, providing transcripts, captions, and descriptions as needed.
- **Training**: All team members should be trained on accessibility best practices and guidelines to ensure a consistent and informed approach.

### Implementing Accessibility

To implement accessibility, several strategies can be employed:
- **Guideline Adherence**: Following established accessibility guidelines like WCAG to ensure compliance with best practices.
- **User Research**: Conducting research and usability testing with users who have disabilities to identify and address potential barriers.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Utilizing accessibility testing tools and assistive technologies during the development and testing phases.
- **Inclusive Design**: Adopting an inclusive design approach that considers the needs of all users from the beginning of the design process.

**Define accessible:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define accessible (computers and software)">Accessible refers to ensuring that individuals with disabilities can utilize technology in the same manner as their non-disabled counterparts. This includes making digital information and technology easily accessible to people with visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities, such as by incorporating assistive technology and features into hardware and software design.</span>

The concept of accessible design and practice of accessible development ensures both "direct access" (i.e. unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers).
