Accessibility: the quality/ability/extent of being accessible. 

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain accessibility (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional contraint)">

Accessibility refers to the ability of a system to be easily accessed and used by people with disabilities or special needs. 

As a system quality attribute, accessibility refers to the degree to which a system is designed and developed in a way that enables users with disabilities, or special needs, to access and use it. This includes a system's ability to provide alternative input and output mechanisms, such as voice commands or text-to-speech, as well as its compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers and Braille displays.

As a non-functional requirement, accessibility is an essential consideration when designing and developing systems and applications that are accessible to people with disabilities. It requires a considered and strategic approach to support the different forms of accessibility.

As a cross-functional constraint, accessibility affects all aspects of the system, from design to implementation and testing. It requires collaboration between designers, developers, and quality assurance teams to ensure that the system meets accessibility standards and guidelines. 

Overall, accessibility is an important consideration for any system or application that aims to accommodate a diverse user base and promote inclusivity. It is a mandatory requirement for public sector websites and mobile applications.

* [OpenAI: accessible](https:://openai.com): <div data-chatgpt-prompt="define accessible (computers and software)">Accessible in the context of computers and software refers to the usability and usability features designed to ensure that individuals with disabilities can utilize technology in the same manner as their non-disabled counterparts. This includes making digital information and technology easily accessible to people with visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities by incorporating assistive technology and features into hardware and software design. Accessible technology benefits users with disabilities by ensuring that they can use technology to enhance their access to information and participate fully in society.</div>
