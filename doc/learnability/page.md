# Learnability

**The quality/ability/extent of being learnable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain learnability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Learnability is a system quality attribute that measures the ease with which users can learn to use a system. It is a non-functional requirement that is related to the usability of a system. A system that is designed to be easy to learn should provide users with a clear and concise interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate.

Learnability is also a cross-functional constraint because it affects the way users interact with a system across different domains. For example, if a user is familiar with one software application, they will expect similar interaction patterns and design principles in another software application. If a system is difficult to learn, it can negatively impact user adoption and satisfaction, as well as productivity and efficiency.

**Define learnable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define learnable (computers and software)">From a computer and software standpoint, learnable refers to the ability of the system to adapt and improve its performance based on real-time feedback and data. A learnable computer system or software is one that can constantly refine itself by learning from user behavior, past actions, and outcomes to optimize its functionality and accuracy. This can be accomplished through machine learning algorithms or other artificial intelligence technologies that enable computers and software to "teach themselves" based on the data available. By being learnable, computers and software can become more efficient, effective, and personalized for individual users, leading to better user experiences and outcomes.
