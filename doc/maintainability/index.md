<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain maintainability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Maintainability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ease with which a software application can be modified, updated, and extended by developers, without requiring excessive effort, time, and costs. It is a non-functional requirement that defines the ability of a system to be easily maintained, repaired, or upgraded without compromising its performance, functionality, or reliability.

Maintainability is a cross-functional constraint that affects all aspects of the software development process, including design, development, testing, and deployment. It impacts the cost and time required for software maintenance, as well as the productivity, expertise, and skills of the development team.

Some of the key factors that influence maintainability include the use of modular and well-structured code, adherence to coding standards and best practices, documentation, version control, testing, and debugging. A highly maintainable system provides benefits such as reduced costs, improved reliability and availability, increased user satisfaction, and enhanced agility and flexibility.

**Define maintainable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define maintainable (computers and software)">Maintainable refers to the ability of a computer or software system to be easily maintained, repaired, or modified over time. A maintainable system is designed to minimize downtime, reduce the risk of errors or bugs, and allow for upgrades or changes to be implemented with minimal disruption. It typically involves using best practices for programming, testing, and documentation, as well as ensuring that the system is scalable and adaptable to future needs. Ultimately, a maintainable system will save time and resources, improve reliability and efficiency, and help to ensure that the system continues to meet the needs of its users over the long term.</span>
