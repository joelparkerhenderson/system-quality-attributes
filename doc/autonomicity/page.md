# Autonomicity

**The quality/ability/extent of being autonomous.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain autonomicity (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint)">

Autonomicity is a system quality attribute that refers to a system's ability to self-manage, self-heal, and self-configure without the need for human intervention. Autonomicity includes other system quality attributes, such as adaptivity and antifragility.

Autonomicity is a non-functional requirement that emphasizes the importance of a system's ability to operate seamlessly and adapt to its environment to achieve its goals. Autonomicity can be especially valuable to improve other non-functional requirements, such as availability, dependability, reliability, and scalability.

Autonomicity is a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple aspects of a system, including its performance, reliability, and security. It requires collaboration among different stakeholders, such as developers, system administrators, and end-users, to ensure that the system is fully autonomous in its operation.

**Define autonomicity:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define autonomicity (computers and software)">Autonomous refers to systems, computers, and software that have the ability to operate and function independently without requiring human intervention or control. Autonomous systems can be programmed to perform specific tasks and make decisions based on pre-determined criteria, and can continue to function even in the absence of a human operator. They utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze and respond to data, allowing them to adapt and improve their performance over time. Examples of autonomous systems include self-driving cars, drones, and automated customer service chatbots.</span>
