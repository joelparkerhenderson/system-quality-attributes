# Autonomicity

Autonomicity: the quality/ability/extent of being autonomous.

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain autonomicity (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Autonomicity is a system quality attribute that refers to a system's ability to self-manage, self-heal, and self-configure without the need for human intervention. 

Autonomicity is a non-functional requirement that emphasizes the importance of a system's ability to operate seamlessly and adapt to its environment to achieve its goals. 

Autonomicity is a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple aspects of a system, including its performance, reliability, and security. It requires collaboration among different stakeholders, such as developers, system administrators, and end-users, to ensure that the system is fully autonomous in its operation.

In summary, Autonomicity is a key attribute that improves the effectiveness and efficiency of a system by reducing manual interventions and allowing the system to adapt to changing scenarios. It minimizes the chances of failures and increases the system's reliability and usability.</span>

* [Wikipedia: Autonomy](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy): The degree that a system can make its own decisions.

* [Dictionary: autonomy](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/autonomy): self-governing; independent; subject to its own laws only. having autonomy; not subject to control from outside; independent. (of a machine, device, etc.) able to operate with little or no human control or intervention.

* [OpenAI: autonomicity](https:://openai.com): <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define autonomicity (computers and software)">Autonomous refers to systems, computers, and software that have the ability to operate and function independently without requiring human intervention or control. Autonomous systems can be programmed to perform specific tasks and make decisions based on pre-determined criteria, and can continue to function even in the absence of a human operator. They utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze and respond to data, allowing them to adapt and improve their performance over time. Examples of autonomous systems include self-driving cars, drones, and automated customer service chatbots.</span>
