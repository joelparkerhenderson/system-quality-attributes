# Refactorability

Refactorability: the quality/ability/extent of being refactorable.

<div data-chatgpt-prompt="explain refactorability (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">Refactorability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ease with which a software system can be modified or improved without affecting its functionality. It is a non-functional requirement that is often a cross-functional constraint, affecting the development, maintenance, and evolution of the software system.

Refactorability depends on the design, architecture, and coding practices of the software system. A well-designed, modular, and structured system is easier to refactor than a monolithic or poorly structured system. Likewise, a system with clean, readable, and maintainable code is easier to refactor than a system with messy or spaghetti code.

Refactoring is an essential activity in software development that helps to improve code quality, maintainability, and scalability of a system. Refactorability, therefore, plays a crucial role in the overall success of a software system by enabling developers to make changes to the system easily and quickly without introducing bugs or breaking the system.</div>

Refactoring involves restructuring, simplifying, or improving the code without altering the end result. A refactorable codebase allows developers to make changes efficiently and maintain it well over time.</div>
