# Resiliency

**The quality/ability/extent of being resilient.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="resiliency + template">

**Resiliency** in systems refers to the ability of a system to recover quickly from disruptions, maintain continuous operation in the face of failures, and adapt to adverse conditions without compromising service quality.

### System Quality Attribute

As a **system quality attribute**, resiliency emphasizes the system's capacity to withstand and recover from failures or unexpected conditions, ensuring continuous and reliable operation.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Fault Tolerance:** The ability of the system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.
- **Recovery:** The speed and effectiveness with which the system can return to normal operation after a disruption.
- **Robustness:** The strength and stability of the system under stress, including its capacity to handle unexpected inputs or conditions.

### Non-Functional Requirement

As a **non-functional requirement** (NFR), resiliency defines the standards and conditions that enable the system to be robust and recoverable, ensuring it can maintain service quality under adverse conditions.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Redundancy:** Incorporating duplicate components and pathways to eliminate single points of failure.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Implementing continuous monitoring systems to detect issues promptly and trigger alerts for rapid response.
- **Backup and Restore:** Ensuring that data and system states are regularly backed up and can be quickly restored after a failure.

### Cross-Functional Constraint

As a **cross-functional constraint**, resiliency imposes requirements that impact various aspects of the system, ensuring that all components and processes are designed to support the system's ability to withstand and recover from disruptions.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Security:** Protecting against security breaches that could compromise system integrity and ensuring resilience against attacks.
- **Performance:** Maintaining acceptable performance levels during and after disruptions, avoiding significant degradation in service.
- **Scalability:** Ensuring that the system can handle increased load or complexity without compromising its resilience.

### Implementing Resiliency

To implement resiliency in a system, consider the following steps:
- **Design for Redundancy:** Incorporate redundant components and pathways to ensure no single point of failure can bring down the system.
- **Implement Continuous Monitoring:** Establish comprehensive monitoring to track system health and performance, detecting issues before they become critical.
- **Automate Failover and Recovery:** Develop automated processes for failover and recovery to minimize downtime and human intervention.
- **Regularly Test Recovery Procedures:** Conduct regular drills and tests of recovery procedures to ensure they are effective and that staff are prepared for real incidents.
- **Ensure Robust Security Measures:** Implement strong security protocols to protect against attacks and ensure the system can recover quickly if breached.
- **Maintain Comprehensive Backups:** Regularly back up critical data and system states, ensuring that backups are secure and can be quickly restored.
- **Document Resilience Plans:** Create and maintain detailed documentation of resilience plans, including response protocols and contact information for key personnel.

By focusing on these aspects and steps, systems can achieve high resiliency, ensuring they remain operational and maintain service quality even in the face of disruptions and adverse conditions.

**Define resilient:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define resilient (computers and software)">Resilient refers to the ability of computers and software to recover quickly and effectively from difficulties or malfunctions. A resilient system is able to withstand unexpected events or disruption, maintain its functionality, and continue to deliver high-performance without significant interruption. This may involve features such as redundancy, failover mechanisms, automated recovery processes, and backups to ensure that data and operations can be quickly restored in the event of a failure.</span>
