# Resiliency

**The quality/ability/extent of being resilient.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain resilience (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Resilience is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to recover quickly and effectively from disruptions or failures.

It is also considered as a non-functional requirement, as it is not related to the functional behavior of the system but rather its ability to accommodate change and maintain its performance under different conditions.

Resilience is often viewed as a cross-functional constraint because it impacts multiple aspects of a system, including performance, reliability, and security. It requires coordination across different functions and stakeholders to ensure that the system is able to withstand and recover from unexpected events.

**Define resilient:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define resilient (computers and software)">Resilient refers to the ability of computers and software to recover quickly and effectively from difficulties or malfunctions. A resilient system is able to withstand unexpected events or disruption, maintain its functionality, and continue to deliver high-performance without significant interruption. This may involve features such as redundancy, failover mechanisms, automated recovery processes, and backups to ensure that data and operations can be quickly restored in the event of a failure.</span>
