# Determinability

**The quality/ability/extent of being determinable.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain determinability (system quality attribute, non-functional requirement, cross-functional constraint )">

Determinability refers to the ability of a system or software application to identify, diagnose, and rectify any errors or problems that may arise during its operation. It is a system quality attribute that ensures the reliability and stability of the system. This non-functional requirement is a cross-functional constraint that impacts various aspects of software development, including design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

Determinability is an essential system quality attribute because it enhances the system's ability to self-diagnose and self-correct any problems that may occur. This attribute contributes to the dependability, fault tolerance, and availability of the system. It also helps to reduce downtime, improve user experience, and increase system efficiency.

To achieve determinability, software developers must design and implement robust error handling mechanisms that can detect and diagnose failures, log error messages, and provide feedback to users. Moreover, they must ensure that the system is capable of recovering from failures and that the recovery process is transparent and reliable.

**Define determinable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define determinable (computers and software)">Determinable in computers and software refers to the quality of being able to be determined, resolved or ascertained. It suggests that a particular software feature, attribute or function can be clearly defined, analyzed, and measured, either by using specific tools, techniques or approaches. In other words, a determinable software component is one that can be quantified, tested, and evaluated based on certain criteria, such as performance, reliability, security, efficiency or scalability, among others. This attribute is essential in software development, as it allows developers to design, implement, and maintain software solutions that meet specific requirements and deliver measurable outcomes.</span>
