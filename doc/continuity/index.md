# Continuity

**Continuity: the quality/ability/extent of being continuous.**

<span data-chatgpt-prompt="explain continuity (system quality attribute, cross-functional constraint, non-functional requirement)">

Continuity refers to the system quality attribute that describes the ability of the system to keep functioning under normal and abnormal conditions, without any noticeable impact on the performance and availability of the system. It is also a non-functional requirement that specifies the expected level of reliability, availability, and maintainability of the system. The continuity of a system is a cross-functional constraint that affects various aspects of the system, including design, development, testing, deployment, and operation.

The continuity of a system encompasses the ability to recover from failures, handle unexpected events, and maintain its functionality and performance in the face of disruptions. It requires that the system design and architecture incorporate redundancy, fault tolerance, and resilience mechanisms that can handle various types of failures and errors. The system should also be capable of monitoring and detecting faults, and initiating appropriate corrective actions.

Continuity is critical in many domains, including financial services, transportation, healthcare, and emergency services, where service disruptions can have severe consequences. It is also essential in industrial and manufacturing settings, where downtime and equipment failures can lead to significant losses in productivity and revenue.

Overall, ensuring the continuity of a system requires a comprehensive approach that involves understanding the system's context, identifying potential risks and failures, and designing appropriate mitigation strategies. It is a vital aspect of system reliability and availability, and an essential requirement for meeting the expectations of users and stakeholders.

**Define continuous:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define continuous (computers and software)">Continuous in the context of computers and software refers to a process or methodology in software development where the code is continuously built, tested, and deployed to production. The developers work on small incremental changes to the codebase, and with each change, the code is automatically tested and deployed. This process helps teams to detect and fix issues and bugs quickly, thereby delivering new features and updates to the end-users rapidly. Additionally, it also helps in increasing the overall reliability and quality of the software product.</span>

In addition to prevention, the goal is to enable ongoing operations before and during execution of disaster recovery. Business continuity is the intended outcome of proper execution of both business continuity planning and disaster recovery.
