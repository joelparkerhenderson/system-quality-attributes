# System quality attributes (SQAs)

System quality attributes (SQAs) refer to a set of characteristics that define the overall quality of computer software systems. These attributes determine how well the system performs in terms of functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, security, and maintainability.

* Functionality: The ability of the software to perform its intended tasks without errors or bugs. It includes features such as accuracy, completeness, and compliance with user requirements.

* Reliability: The software's ability to operate consistently and predictably under various conditions. It includes attributes like fault tolerance, availability, and recoverability.

* Usability: The ease of use and learnability of the software. It includes attributes like user interface design, user experience, and accessibility.

* Efficiency: The software's ability to perform its tasks in a timely and resource-efficient manner. It includes attributes like speed, processing time, and memory usage.

* Security: The software's ability to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. It includes attributes like confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

* Maintainability: The software's ability to be modified or updated easily to meet changing requirements. It includes attributes like scalability, modularity, and extensibility.



# Cross-functional constraints (CFCs)

Cross-functional constraints (CFCs) refer to limitations or restrictions imposed on software development projects that arise due to the interaction between different functional areas of a business or organization. These areas may include technical areas such as design, development, testing, and operations, as well as non-technical areas such as marketing, finance, and project management.

For example, a cross-functional constraint could be a delay in the project caused by a bottleneck in the testing phase because the design team did not provide the necessary documentation to the testing team to carry out their testing activities. Another constraint could be a budgetary constraint that limits the amount of resources available to the development team, which in turn affects the quality of the final product.

While cross-functional constraints, system quality attributes, and non-functional requirements are all related, they focus on different aspects of a system's design and implementation:

* Cross-functional constraints highlight the need for coordination and collaboration between different functions within an organization to ensure that decisions are made in a holistic and integrated manner. 

* System quality attributes and non-functional requirements, on the other hand, help to ensure that the system performs efficiently and effectively based on the organization's needs and requirements.

In general, cross-functional constraints can arise from a variety of factors, including communication gaps, conflicting priorities, competing goals, and organizational silos. To manage these constraints effectively, teams must have a clear understanding of the interdependencies among areas, and must collaborate to identify and address potential issues. Effective communication, stakeholder management, and strategic planning are critical to managing cross-functional constraints and delivering successful projects.


# Non-functional requirements (NFRs)

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) refer to the characteristics or qualities of software that do not relate to its specific functionality. These requirements represent the quality attributes of a system and define its overall aspects such as performance, scalability, reliability, usability, accessibility, maintainability, and more.

Examples:

* Performance: The system should carry out tasks within an expected response time, resource utilization, and throughput rate.

* Scalability: The system should handle increasing amounts of users, data, and tasks, while maintaining its performance.

* Reliability: The system should be working well enough, even when showing indications of deteriorating performance.

* Usability: This system should provide user interfaces and user experiences that help end-users succeed.

* Accessibility: The system should work well for people with disabilities, and also satisfy legal and ethical obligations.

* Maintainability: The system should be easily accessible for maintenance, and also maintenance costs should be low.

Non-functional requirements are critical to ensure the success of the system. By including non-functional requirements in the software development process, businesses can ensure that their software meets the expectations of stakeholders and end-users.


# Cross-cutting concerns (CCCs)


Cross-cutting concerns refer to aspects of software design and implementation that happen across multiple modules or components of the software system. These aspects typically relate to functionality that is not directly related to the primary purpose or business logic of the software system.

Examples of cross-cutting concerns in software design include:

* Security: authentication, authorization, and access control

* Logging and auditing: tracking user actions and system events

* Caching: optimizing performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory

* Error handling: managing and reporting errors and exceptions

* Transaction management: ensuring data consistency

Cross-cutting concerns are often implemented using aspect-oriented programming (AOP) techniques, which allow developers to modularize and encapsulate these concerns separately from the primary functionality of the software system. This can reduce code duplication, and make the system easier to maintain and evolve over time.

* AOP achieves this by introducing the concept of aspects. Each aspect encapsulates a specific behavior or logic and can be applied to multiple code modules or classes.

* AOP aspects are defined separately from the core program logic and can be woven into the program at various stages, such as compile-time or runtime.

* AOP differs from typical procedural programming and object-oriented programming, which typically has concerns  interspersed throughout the code, leading to code duplication, increased complexity, and reduced reusability.




# Accessibility

**The quality/ability/extent of being accessible.**


Accessibility refers to the ability of a system to be easily accessed and used by people with disabilities or special needs. Accessibility is an important consideration for any system or application that aims to accommodate a diverse user base and promote inclusivity. It is a mandatory requirement for public sector websites and applications.

**As a system quality attribute:** accessibility refers to the degree to which a system is designed and developed in a way that enables users with disabilities, or special needs, to access and use it. This includes a system's ability to provide alternative input and output mechanisms, such as voice commands or text-to-speech, as well as its compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers and Braille displays.

**As a non-functional requirement:** accessibility is an essential consideration when designing and developing systems and applications that are accessible to people with disabilities. It requires a considered and strategic approach to support the different forms of accessibility.

**As a cross-functional constraint:** accessibility affects all aspects of the system, from design to implementation and testing. It requires collaboration between designers, developers, and quality assurance teams to ensure that the system meets accessibility standards and guidelines, and complies with company policies and governmental laws.


**Define accessible:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define accessible (computers and software)">Accessible in the context of computers and software refers to ensuring that individuals with disabilities can utilize technology in the same manner as their non-disabled counterparts. This includes making digital information and technology easily accessible to people with visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities, such as by incorporating assistive technology and features into hardware and software design.



# Accountability

**The quality/ability/extent of being accountable.**


Accountability refers to the ability of a system to have clear identification and tracking of responsibilities, actions, and outcomes related to a system or process.

**As a system quality attribute:** accountability assesses the reliability and trustworthiness of a system, as it ensures that individuals or entities involved in a given process are responsible and answerable for their actions or decisions.

**As a non-functional requirement:** accountability sets expectations for the performance and security of a system, specifying that it must provide clear records and audit trails, access controls, and other measures that mitigate the risk of fraud, corruption, or errors.

**As a cross-functional constraint:** accountability affects several aspects of a system's design and operation, such as governance, risk management, compliance, and legal requirements. It often involves collaboration and alignment between different stakeholders, including developers, administrators, auditors, and users, and may require specific policies, procedures, or tools to ensure its proper implementation.


**Define accountable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define accountable (computers and software)"> Accountable, in the context of computers and software, refers to the state or capability of a system or application to record and report on the actions of its users or components. It means that every action taken within the system or application can be traced back to the person or entity responsible for it. This can include logging user activity, tracking data changes, and maintaining an audit trail of all system events. This feature is typically implemented to ensure transparency, meet regulatory requirements, and enable effective troubleshooting and incident response.



# Accuracy

**The quality/ability/extent of being accurate. Compare precision.**


Accuracy is a system quality attribute, which refers to the degree to which the system produces correct and reliable results. It measures how closely the output of the system matches the expected output. Accurate systems provide reliable and trustworthyresults and may also enhance user confidence and satisfaction.

Accuracy is a non-functional requirement, and affects many aspects of the system and depends on the interplay of various components and processes. It is often linked with other system quality attributes such as completeness, consistency, and correctness, and is related to factors such as data quality, input validation, and error handling. Accurate results are essential in systems where decisions are based on the output, such as financial, medical, or safety-critical systems.

Accuracy is a cross-functional constraint, ensuring accuracy in a system requires careful design, testing, and validation, with collaboration among stakeholder teams such as business analysis and subject-matter experts (SMEs). This includes verifying data inputs, detecting and handling errors, validating algorithms and calculations, and establishing quality control mechanisms. Accuracy may have legal, contractual, and financial implications, thus involving an organization's lawyers, compliance officers, and risk management planners.


**Define accurate:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define accurate (computers and software)">Accurate refers to the ability of computers and software systems to produce results that are free from errors or discrepancies and are very close to the true or expected value. In other words, accuracy is the degree of conformity of the output of a system to the correct or expected value. It is a critical measure of the reliability and effectiveness of computer-based systems, as accurate information is essential for decision-making, analysis, and other important tasks. The accuracy of a system depends on various factors, including the precision of the algorithms used, the quality of the data input, and the limitations of the hardware being used.



# ACIDity

**The quality/ability/extent of being ACID.**


ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties guarantees reliable processing of data transactions.

Atomicity: the property of a transaction that ensures that either all changes made during the transaction are committed or none at all. If a transaction fails for any reason, all the changes made within it are rolled back, returning the system to its original state.

Consistency: the fact that the system's data state will remain valid before and after a transaction. This means that the rules and constraints defined in the database must be followed consistently.

Isolation: the property that ensures that a transaction runs independently of other transactions. This is important to prevent interference from other transactions and errors that could result from concurrent access to data.

Durability: the property that guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it is permanently saved even in the case of system failures or crashes. 

ACIDity is a system quality attribute, which is a property or characteristic of a system that describes its overall quality, especially with regard to databases and transactions.

ACIDity a non-functional requirement, as it describes how the system should behave overall.  For some high scalability systems, ACID is difficult to achieve practically or cost-effectively, and may be superseded by eventual consistency.

ACIDity is typically not an important cross-functional constraint, because in practice many organizations are in favor of  ACID and using it regularly.


**Define ACID:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define ACID (computers and software)">ACID refers to a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. These properties ensure that data remains accurate, reliable, and consistent, even when multiple users are simultaneously accessing and modifying data.



# Adaptability

**The quality/ability/extent of being adaptable. Compare adaptivity.**


Adaptability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to have its users adjust or modify its behavior or structure in response to changing environmental conditions. This can include changes to the system's input or output, its user interfaces, its resources or processing capabilities, or its communication protocols.

**As a non-functional requirement:** adaptability is a qualitative attribute that describes a system's user's ability to change the system effectively. It is often an essential consideration for systems with users who need to function under different operating conditions, where specific environmental factors (such as load fluctuation, network connectivity, and data volume) might impact system performance.

Adaptability is also a cross-functional constraint that can affect various parts of the system's design, including user interfaces, and data management. For example, adaptable user interfaces enable users to modify the system to accommodate changing needs. In the same way, adaptable data management should be capable of having users change data structures, data business logic, and so forth.<!--cfc-tech-->


**Define adaptable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define adaptable (computers and software)">Adaptable means capable of adjusting or modifying to fit different situations or conditions as needed, especially in response to changing circumstances without significant difficulty. In the context of computers and software, adaptable refers to the ability of software or hardware to easily and efficiently adjust to new or changing requirements, configuration, or interfaces without requiring extensive reconfiguration or coding changes. Adaptable systems can easily integrate new features, upgrades, or changes to the environment without compromising performance, user experience, or stability.



# Adaptivity

**The quality/ability/extent of being adaptive.**


Adaptivity is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to respond and adapt to changes in its environment or requirements. Compare adaptability and antifragility.

Adaptivity is a non-functional requirement because it doesn't relate to the specific functionality of a system, but rather the system's ability to adapt to changes in its environment, such as an increasing need for system resources, or service degradations in system dependencies.

Examples of postive-oriented adaptivity are autoscaling and elastic clouds, such as when a system can automatically allocate more processing power, memory, storage, bandwidth, and the like.
  
Examples of negative-oriented adaptivity are throttling and backpressure, such as when a system can slow its inbound queues, as well as report the issue to upstream providers, in order to prevent overloading.

Adaptivity is a cross-functional constraint, in practice, because different organization teams have different perspectives on the value of adaptivity, and it can be challenging to understand. As a typical example, a sales team may want a web sales process that is always available, even during peak usage periods that may be ten times higher than normal; this can be solved by the sales team and development team coordination on the adaptivity qualities.



**Define adaptive:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define adaptive (computers and software)">Adaptive in the context of computers and software refers to the ability of the system to adjust and respond to changing circumstances. Adaptive software is designed to gather information about its usage, and then use that information to modify its own behavior to better meet the system's goals.



# Administrability

**The quality/ability/extent of being administerable.**


Administrability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ease with which a system can be managed and maintained by system administrators or operators. An administrable system is one that allows administrators to perform tasks such as configuration, deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting with ease. An administrable system is important because it reduces the time and resources required for administration, increases system reliability and availability, and improves user satisfaction.

Administrability is also considered a non-functional requirement as it focuses on how the system should perform rather than what it should do for end-users. To enhance administrability, a system should be designed with features such as user-friendly interfaces, clear documentation, automated processes, efficient logging and reporting, and effective security controls. 

Administrability is a cross-functional constraint because it affects the entire system and requires collaboration between different roles such as developers, testers, and stakeholder administrators. Additionally, system administrators should be involved in the development process from the start to identify potential issues and ensure that the system is designed with manageability in mind.


**Define administerable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define administerable (computers and software)">Administerable refers to hardware or software that can be managed and controlled by an administrator or an authorized user.

# Affordability

**The quality/ability/extent of being afforable.**


Affordability is a system quality attribute, which refers to the ability of a system or product to be economically feasible for its intended use or market. In other words, affordability is the measure of how easily accessible and reasonable the cost of a product or service is to its potential customers.

Affordability can be considered as a non-functional requirement, as it directly impacts the usability of the system. If a system is very expensive to build, maintain or operate, it may not be feasible for a large number of users or organizations, and hence become less desirable.

Affordability can also be viewed as a cross-functional constraint, as it affects multiple aspects of the development process, such as design, testing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, and sales. Affordability is also critically important for product teams that are doing market discovery, customer discovery, competitive research, and business analysis such as SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).

It is essential that the development team considers affordability as a key factor during the entire development lifecycle to ensure that the final product or service is economically viable, useful, and accessible to end-users.


**Define affordable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define affordable (computers and software)">Affordable refers to something that is priced reasonably and within financial reach of a particular customer. In regards to computers and software, affordable could mean products that are priced lower than the average market price or those that offer a good value for money to customers on a budget. Again, what is considered "affordable" depends on each individual's financial situation, needs, and preferences.



# Agility

**The quality/ability/extent of being agile.**


Agility is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to adapt to changing requirements and environments quickly and efficiently.

Agility is a non-functional requirement because it does not describe the specific functionalities of a system, but rather how well it can operate under certain circumstances. To achieve agility, a system should be designed with modularity, flexibility, scalability, and robustness in mind. Additionally, an agile system requires a strong testing and validation process to ensure that changes can be made while maintaining system integrity and functional requirements. An agile system can easily change and evolve over time to meet new demands, make modifications or enhancements, and respond to unforeseen events.

Agility can also be considered a cross-functional constraint because it affects multiple stakeholders of a system, including its developers, project managers, product leaders, and accountable executives. Notably, Agile is a software development methodology, and an approach to project management, that emphasizes cross-functional collaboration, flexibility, continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction.


**Define agile:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define agile (computers and software)">Agile an approach to project management. It relies on iterative and incremental development, quick responses to changes and feedback, and effective communication among team members. Agile principles prioritize delivering value to the customer and achieving business goals through adaptive planning, regular inspection, and adaptation of the project scope, design, and requirements. Agile methods are widely used in software development, and they are also applicable to other industries and domains seeking to increase efficiency, innovation, and quality in their products and services.



# Antifragility

**The quality/ability/extent of being antifragile.**


Antifragility is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to thrive and improve under stress, shock, or change, instead of just surviving it. It is a property of systems that have the ability to constantly adapt and grow stronger in the face of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity of their environment.  Compare self-sustainability.

**As a non-functional requirement:** antifragility is typically related to the resilience, reliability, and robustness of a system. It defines the system's ability to withstand unexpected or unforeseen changes in its environment, mitigate risks and failures, and recover quickly from any disruption.

Antifragility is also a cross-functional constraint because it impacts various aspects of a system, such as its design, architecture, operations, maintenance, and security. It requires the collaboration of different teams and disciplines, such as development, testing, operations, security, and business, to ensure that the system is built, deployed, and managed in a way that enhances its antifragile properties.



**Define antifragile:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define antifragile (computers and software)">Antifragile is a term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book "Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder." It describes a system or entity that becomes stronger and more resilient when exposed to stressors or adversity, as opposed to simply withstanding them or breaking under the pressure.



# Atomicity

**The quality/ability/extent of being atomic transactionally.**


Atomicity is a system quality attribute that refers to the property of a system where a sequence of operations is treated as a single, indivisible transaction. In other words, the atomicity of a system is the guarantee that a series of related operations will either succeed or fail as a single unit, without any partial completion.

Atomicity is also considered a non-functional requirement because it does not deal with the specific functionalities of the system, but rather with its overall behavior and performance. It is a critical non-functional requirement for systems that handle complex transactions, such as finance and banking.

Atomicity can be a cross-functional constraint, because most organizational teams want atomicity, and rely on it. However, some high-scalability systems may need to change from atomicity to other approaches such as eventual consistency, or out-of-order event stream processing, or probability-weighted transactions.

To achieve atomicity, a system should have mechanisms that ensure that transactions are executed reliably, securely, and consistently. These mechanisms should support rollback and recovery, isolation, and consistency of the data, and ensure that the system is fault-tolerant and available.


**Define atomic:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define atomic (computers and software)">An atomic transaction is a data transaction in which a series of data operations are treated as a single, indivisible operation. In other words, either all of the operations are executed and the transaction is committed, or none of the operations are executed and the transaction is rolled back. This guarantees that data are always in a consistent state, even if an error occurs during the transaction. Atomicity is one of the four key properties of an ACID data transaction.



# Auditability

**The quality/ability/extent of being auditable.**


Auditability is a system quality attribute that refers to the ability of a system to provide reliable and accurate data for auditing purposes. Auditability is important in many industries, such as finance, healthcare, and government,  where strict regulations often require auditing of system activities and transactions. Auditability can also help organizations to identify issues and improve processes.

Auditability is a non-functional requirement that is typically also a cross-cutting concern, because a system must be designed with clear and transparent processes that can be easily tracked and recorded, across all functions and modules. The system should store and maintain appropriate logs, records, and metadata that can be used to reconstruct system activities over time; this includes data such as user activity, access logs, transaction records, and system changes. Audit logs can be stored and analyzed to detect security breaches, fraud, data breaches or any other potential risks to the system or organization. 
 
Auditability is a cross-functional constraint, requiring collaboration between various departments such as development, operations, cybersecurity, physical security, legal, compliance, and risk managment. The system must be designed with security in mind to ensure that data is not compromised or lost, and compliance regulations are met. It must also be easy to audit, with clear documentation and reporting that can be easily reviewed by auditors or other stakeholders.


**Define auditable:** <span data-chatgpt-prompt="define auditable (computers and software)">Auditable refers to the capability of tracking events or changes in a system, so the tracking can be reviewed later for compliance, security, or regulatory purposes.
