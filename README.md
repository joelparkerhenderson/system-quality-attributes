# System Quality Attributes

System quality attributes (SQAs) refer to a set of characteristics that describe capabilities of a given system, such as a computer software program, or a business process, or an organizational practice. System quality attributes determine how well the system performs in terms of aspects such as functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, security, and maintainability.

## Introduction

This project explains 100+ system quality attributes, one by one, in the list below.

* If you're new to this topic, you may want to first read about these related concepts: [system quality attributes](doc/system-quality-attriburtes (SQAs)), [cross-functional constraints (CFCs)](doc/cross-functional-constraints/), [non-functional requirements (NFRs)](doc/non-functional-requirements/), [cross-cutting concerns (CCCs)](doc/cross-cutting-concerns/).

* If you're an implementor, then you may want to read about planning and tracking: [Key Performance Indicator (KPI)](doc/key-performance-indicator/), [Quality Assessment Report (QAR)](doc/quality-assessment-report/), [System Quality Attributes Maturity Model (SQAMM)](doc/system-quality-attributes-maturity-model/), [Software Quality Assessment based on Lifecycle Expectations (SQALE)](doc/software-quality-assessment-based-on-lifecycle-expectations/), [Chaos Engineering](doc/chaos-engineering/).

* These topics are based on hundreds of projects with startups, enterprises, government organizations, nonprofits, and consultancies. The language output is from ChatGPT because it writes well enough for workplace use. Everything here is human proofread by [Joel Parker Henderson](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/).
